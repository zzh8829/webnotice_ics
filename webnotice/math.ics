 ent of Pure Mathematics\n  and  St. Jerome's University\nTitle:   "Polar P

 ster at: https://ticketfi.com/event/1991/bridges-lecture-series-morarulack
 enbauer-jan-3118  \n\nAbstract:  The first Bridges lecture in 2018 will ex
 plore how humans have sought to make the Arctic legible (to borrow the phr
 ase of James C. Scott)\, from pre-contact Inuit understandings of space an
 d time\, through the practices and instruments of European maritime explor
 ers\, through the introduction of aviation and the refinement of Arctic ai
 r navigation\, to the age of satellites. By bringing history\, geography\,
  and geometry into dialogue\, Professors Moraru and Lackenbauer will discu
 ss how humans have measured\, defined\, and characterised space and time\,
  and how mathematics continues to explain what is possible Â– and what is 
 not.  \n \n
