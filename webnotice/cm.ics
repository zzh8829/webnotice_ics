DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Dr. Jean-Christophe Nave\, Department of Mathematics
  and Statistics\, McGill University\nTitle:   "Simulating fluid flows with
  large and small scales without having to pay (too much) for it" \n\nRemar
 ks:  Refreshments served at 3:45pm in MC 6460  \n\nAbstract:  There are tw
 o fundamental numerical challenges associated with solving fluid flow prob
 lems involving multiple fluids/components/phases/scales: (1) solving PDEs 
 with discontinuous coefficients and interface conditions\, (2) evolving in
  time the geometry (e.g.\, a density\, a concentration\, the interface bet
 ween air and water Â…) \nIn this talk I will present high-order numerical 
 techniques to solve these problems on a regular Cartesian grid. First\, I 
 will introduce the Correction Function Method (CFM) framework and will app
 ly it to solve a canonical problem: Poisson's equation with interface jump
  discontinuities. Second\, I will introduce the Gradient-Augmented Level S
 et Method (GALSM) and will apply it to the problem of evolving interfaces 
 separating the various fluid domains.\nThroughout this talk I will illustr
 ate our approach with simulations of physical systems. I will end by showi
 ng a surprising extension of the methods developed to solve with arbitrary
  resolution the incompressible Euler equations.  \n \n
