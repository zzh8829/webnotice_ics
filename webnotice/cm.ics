DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Prof. Mauro Maggioni\, Bloomberg Distinguished Profe
 ssor\, John Hopkins University\nTitle:   "Geometric Methods for the Approx
 imation of High-dimensional Dynamical Systems" \n\nRemarks:  Refreshments 
 served at 3:45 pm  \n\nAbstract:  We discuss geometry-based statistical le
 arning techniques for performing model reduction and modeling of certain c
 lasses of stochastic high-dimensional dynamical systems. We consider two c
 omplementary settings. In the first one\, we are given long trajectories o
 f a system\, e.g. from molecular dynamics\, and we estimate\, in a robust 
 fashion\, an effective number of degrees of freedom of the system\, which 
 may vary in the state space of then system\, and a local scale where the d
 ynamics is well-approximated by a reduced dynamics with a small number of 
 degrees of freedom. We then use these ideas to produce an approximation to
  the generator of the system and obtain\, via eigenfunctions of an empiric
 al Fokker-Planck equation (constructed from data)\, reaction coordinates f
 or the system that capture the large time behavior of the dynamics. We pre
 sent various examples from molecular dynamics illustrating these ideas. \n
 In the second setting we only have access to a (large number of expensive)
  simulators that can return short paths of the stochastic system\, and int
 roduce a statistical learning framework for estimating local approximation
 s to the system\, that can be (automatically) pieced together to form a fa
 st global reduced model for the system\, called ATLAS. ATLAS is guaranteed
  to be accurate (in the sense of producing stochastic paths whose distribu
 tion is close to that of paths generated by the original system) not only 
 at small time scales\, but also at large time scales\, under suitable assu
 mptions on the dynamics. We discuss applications to homogenization of roug
 h diffusions in low and high dimensions\, as well as relatively simple sys
 tems with separations of time scales\, and deterministic chaotic systems i
 n high-dimensions\, that are well-approximated by stochastic diffusion-lik
 e equations.  \n \n
