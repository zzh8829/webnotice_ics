DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Paul Garthwaite\, the Open UniversityTitle: "Tweaki
 ng variables to make them uncorrelated"\nRemarks: Refreshments will be p
 rovided. \nAbstract: Interpreting the results of a statistical analysis wo
 uld be easier if all variables were uncorrelated and all data sets consist
 ed of orthogonal x-variables. Principal components is one way of obtaining
  orthogonal/uncorrelated variables\, but the relationship between the prin
 cipal components and the original x-variables is complex. This talk propos
 es two transformations that give orthogonal/uncorrelated components with a
  close one-to-one correspondence between the x-variables and the component
 s.\nThe transformations have a number of useful applications including:\na
  unified approach to the identification and diagnosis of collinearities\ne
 valuating the contributions of individual variables to a Mahalanobis dista
 nce or the test statistic of a Hotelling test\nsetting prior weights for B
 ayesian model averaging\nevaluating the contributions of individual variab
 les to a multiple regression\ncalculation of an upper bound for a multivar
 iate Chebyshev inequality.\nThe talk will focus on the first three of thes
 e applications. \n\n
