DESCRIPTION:A Tale of Two Parasites: how can Gaussian processes contribute
  to improved public health in Africa?\nProf. Peter Diggle\, Lancaster Univ
 ersity\n\nRefreshments will be provided.\nIn this talk\, I will rst make s
 ome general comments about the role of statistical modelling in scientic r
 esearch\, illustrated by two examples from infectious disease epidemiology
 . I will then describe in detail how statistical modelling based on Gaussi
 an spatial stochastic processes has been used to construct region-wide ris
 k maps to inform the operation of a multi-national control programme for o
 nchocerciasis (river blindness) in equatorial Africa. Finally\, I will des
 cribe work-in progress aimed at exploiting recent developments in mobile m
 icroscopy to enable more precise local predictions of community-level risk
 .
