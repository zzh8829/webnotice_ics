DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Georgios Pitselis\, University of Piraeus\nTitle:   
 "Risk Measures in a Quantile Regression Credibility Framework" \n\nRemarks
 :  Refreshments will be provided.  \n\nAbstract:  Here\, we extend the ide
 a of embedding the classical credibility model into risk measures\, as was
  presented by Pitselis (2016)\, to the idea of embedding regression credib
 ility into risk measures. The resulting credible regression risk measures 
 capture the risk of individual insurer's contract (in finance\, the indivi
 dual asset return portfolio) as well as the portfolio risk consisting of s
 everal similar but not identical contracts (in finance\, several similar p
 ortfolios of asset returns)\,  which are grouped together to share the ris
 k. In insurance\, credibility plays a special role of spreading the risk. 
 In financial terminology\, credibility plays a special role of diversifica
 tion of risk. For each model\, regression credibility models are establish
 ed  and  the robustness of these models is investigated. Applications to F
 ama/French financial portfolio data are also presented.  \n \n
