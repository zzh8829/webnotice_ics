DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Yimin Xiao\, Michigan State University\nTitle:   "Ex
 cursion Probabilities and Geometric Properties of Multivariate Gaussian Ra
 ndom Fields" \n\nRemarks:  Refreshments will be provided.  \n\nAbstract:  
 Excursion probabilities of Gaussian random fields have many applications i
 n statistics (e.g.\, scanning statistic and control of false discovery rat
 e (FDR)) and in other areas. The study of excursion probabilities has had 
 a long history and is closely related to geometry of Gaussian random field
 s. In recent years\, important developments have been made in both probabi
 lity and statistics.\n In this talk\, we consider the excursion probabilit
 ies of bivariate Gaussian random fields with non-smooth (or fractal) sampl
 e functions and study their geometric properties and excursion probabiliti
 es. Important classes of multivariate Gaussian random fields are those sta
 tionary with Mat√©rn cross-covariance functions [Gneiting\, Kleiber\, and 
 Schlather (2010)] and operator fractional Brownian motions which are opera
 tor-self-similar with stationary increments.  \n \n    \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Marie-Pier Cote\, Laval University\nTitle:   "Backgr
 ound risk model and inference based on ranks of residuals" \n\nRemarks:  R
 efreshments will be provided.  \n\nAbstract:  It is often easier to model 
 the behaviour of a random vector by choosing the marginal distributions an
 d the copula separately rather than using a classical multivariate distrib
 ution. Many copula families\, including the classes of Archimedean and ell
 iptical copulas\, may be written as the survival copula of a random vector
  R(X\,Y)\, where R is a strictly positive random variable independent of t
 he random vector (X\,Y). A unified framework is presented for studying the
  dependence structure underlying this stochastic representation\, which is
  called the background risk model. However\, in many applications\, part o
 f the dependence may be explained by observable external factors\, which j
 ustifies the use of generalized linear models for the marginal distributio
 ns. In this case and under some conditions that will be discussed\, the in
 ference on the copula can be based on the ranks of suitable residuals.  \n
