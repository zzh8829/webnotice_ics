DESCRIPTION:Risk Measures in a Quantile Regression Credibility Framework\n
 Georgios Pitselis\, University of Piraeus\n\nRefreshments will be provided
 .\nHere\, we extend the idea of embedding the classical credibility model 
 into risk measures\, as was presented by Pitselis (2016)\, to the idea of 
 embedding regression credibility into risk measures. The resulting credibl
 e regression risk measures capture the risk of individual insurer's contra
 ct (in finance\, the individual asset return portfolio) as well as the por
 tfolio risk consisting of several similar but not identical contracts (in 
 finance\, several similar portfolios of asset returns)\,  which are groupe
 d together to share the risk. In insurance\, credibility plays a special r
 ole of spreading the risk. In financial terminology\, credibility plays a 
 special role of diversification of risk. For each model\, regression credi
 bility models are established  and  the robustness of these models is inve
 stigated. Applications to Fama/French financial portfolio data are also pr
 esented.
