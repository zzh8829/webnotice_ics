 tte\nTitle:   "Analysis of Generalized Semiparametric Mixed Varying-Coeffi
 cient Effects Model for Longitudinal Data" \n\nRemarks:  Refreshments will
  be provided.  \n\nAbstract:  The generalized semiparametric mixed varying
 -coefficient effects model for longitudinal data that can flexibly model d
 ifferent types of covariate effects. Different link functions can be selec
 ted to provide a rich family of models for longitudinal data. The mixed va
 rying-coefficient effects model accommodates constant effects\, time-varyi
 ng effects\, and covariate-varying effects. The time-varying effects are u
 nspecified functions of time and the covariate-varying effects are nonpara
 metric functions of a possibly time-dependent exposure variable. We develo
 p the semiparametric estimation procedure by using local linear smoothing 
 and profile weighted least squares estimation techniques. The method requi
 res smoothing in two different and yet connected domains for time and the 
 time-dependent exposure variable. The estimators of the nonparametric effe
 cts are obtained through aggregations to improve efficiency. The asymptoti
 c properties are investigated for the estimators of both nonparametric and
  parametric effects. Some hypothesis tests are developed to examine the co
 variate effects. The finite sample properties of the proposed estimators a
 nd tests are examined through simulations with satisfactory performances. 
 The proposed methods are used to analyze the ACTG 244 clinical trial to in
 vestigate the effects of antiretroviral treatment switching in HIV infecte
 d patients before and after developing the codon 215 mutation.  \n \n

SUMMARY:Probability models for discretization uncertainty with adaptive gr

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Oksana Chkrebtii\, The Ohio State University\nTitle:
    "Probability models for discretization uncertainty with adaptive grid d
 esigns for systems of differential equations" \n\nRemarks:  Refreshments w
 ill be provided.  \n\nAbstract:  When models are defined implicitly by sys
 tems of differential equations without a closed form solution\, small loca
 l errors in finite-dimensional solution approximations can propagate into 
 large deviations from the true underlying state trajectory. Inference for 
 such models relies on a likelihood approximation constructed around a nume
 rical solution\, which underestimates posterior uncertainty. This talk wil
 l introduce and discuss progress in a new adaptive formalism for modeling 
 and propagating discretization uncertainty through the Bayesian inferentia
 l framework\, allowing exact inference and uncertainty quantification for 
 discretized differential equation models.  \n \n
