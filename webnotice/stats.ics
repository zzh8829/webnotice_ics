DESCRIPTION:Tweaking variables to make them uncorrelated\nPaul Garthwa
 ite\, the Open University\nSeminar\n\n\nInterpreting the results of a stat
 istical analysis would be easier if all variables were uncorrelated and al
 l data sets consisted of orthogonal x-variables. Principal components is o
 ne way of obtaining orthogonal/uncorrelated variables\, but the relationsh
 ip between the principal components and the original x-variables is comple
 x. This talk proposes two transformations that give orthogonal/uncorrelate
 d components with a close one-to-one correspondence between the x-variable
 s and the components.\nRefreshments will be provided.
