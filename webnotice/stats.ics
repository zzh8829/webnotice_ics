DESCRIPTION:Tweaking variables to make them uncorrelated\nPaul Garthwa
 ite\, the Open University\n\nRefreshments will be provided.\nInterpreting 
 the results of a statistical analysis would be easier if all variables wer
 e uncorrelated and all data sets consisted of orthogonal x-variables. Prin
 cipal components is one way of obtaining orthogonal/uncorrelated variables
 \, but the relationship between the principal components and the original 
 x-variables is complex. This talk proposes two transformations that give o
 rthogonal/uncorrelated components with a close one-to-one correspondence b
 etween the x-variables and the components.
