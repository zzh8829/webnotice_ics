DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Paul Garthwaite\, the Open University\nTitle:   "T
 weaking variables to make them uncorrelated" \n\nRemarks:  Refreshments 
 will be provided.  \n\nAbstract:  Interpreting the results of a statistica
 l analysis would be easier if all variables were uncorrelated and all data
  sets consisted of orthogonal x-variables. Principal components is one way
  of obtaining orthogonal/uncorrelated variables\, but the relationship bet
 ween the principal components and the original x-variables is complex. Thi
 s talk proposes two transformations that give orthogonal/uncorrelated comp
 onents with a close one-to-one correspondence between the x-variables and 
 the components.\n The transformations have a number of useful applications
  including:\n a unified approach to the identification and diagnosis of co
 llinearities\nevaluating the contributions of individual variables to a Ma
 halanobis distance or the test statistic of a Hotelling test\nsetting prio
 r weights for Bayesian model averaging\nevaluating the contributions of in
 dividual variables to a multiple regression\ncalculation of an upper bound
  for a multivariate Chebyshev inequality.\nThe talk will focus on the firs
 t three of these applications.  \n \n
