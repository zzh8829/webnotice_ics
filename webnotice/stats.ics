SUMMARY:A Tale of Two Parasites: how can Gaussian processes contribute to improved public health in Africa? (Seminar)
LOCATION:STC 0050
DESCRIPTION:A Tale of Two Parasites: how can Gaussian processes contribute to improved public health in Africa?\nProf. Peter Diggle, Lancaster University\n\nRefreshments will be provided.\n\nIn this talk, I will rst make some general comments about the role of statistical modelling in scientic research, illustrated by two examples from infectious disease epidemiology. I will then describe in detail how statistical modelling based on Gaussian spatial stochastic processes has been used to construct region-wide risk maps to inform the operation of a multi-national control programme for onchocerciasis (river blindness) in equatorial Africa. Finally, I will describe work-in progress aimed at exploiting recent developments in mobile microscopy to enable more precise local predictions of community-level risk.
