DESCRIPTION:A Tale of Two Parasites: how can Gaussian processes contribute
  to improved public health in Africa?\nProf. Peter Diggle\, Lancaster Univ
 ersity\nRefreshments will be provided.\nIn this talk\, I will rst make som
 e general comments about the role of statistical modelling in scientic res
 earch\, illustrated by two examples from infectious disease epidemiology. 
 I will then describe in detail how statistical modelling based on Gaussian
  spatial stochastic processes has been used to construct region-wide risk 
 maps to inform the operation of a multi-national control programme for onc
 hocerciasis (river blindness) in equatorial Africa. Finally\, I will descr
 ibe work-in progress aimed at exploiting recent developments in mobile mic
 roscopy to enable more precise local predictions of community-level risk.
