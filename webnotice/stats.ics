DESCRIPTION:Tweaking variables to make them uncorrelated\nPaul Garthwa
 ite\, the Open University\nstats\nSeminar\n\n\nInterpreting the results of
  a statistical analysis would be easier if all variables were uncorrelated
  and all data sets consisted of orthogonal x-variables. Principal componen
 ts is one way of obtaining orthogonal/uncorrelated variables\, but the rel
 ationship between the principal components and the original x-variables is
  complex. This talk proposes two transformations that give orthogonal/unco
 rrelated components with a close one-to-one correspondence between the x-v
 ariables and the components.\nRefreshments will be provided.
