DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Boxiang Wang\, University of Minnesota\nTitle:   "Mo
 dern Classification with Big Data" \n\nRemarks:  Refreshments will be prov
 ided.  \n\nAbstract:  Rapid advances in information technologies have ushe
 red in the era of "big data" and revolutionized the scientific research. B
 ig data creates golden opportunities but has also arisen unprecedented cha
 llenges due to the massive size and complex structure of the data. Among m
 any tasks in statistics and machine learning\, classification has diverse 
 applications\, ranging from improving daily life to reaching the new front
 iers of science and engineering. This talk will discuss the envisions of b
 roader approaches to modern classification methodologies\, as well as comp
 utational considerations to cope with the big data challenges. I will pres
 ent a modern classification method named data-driven generalized distance-
 weighted discrimination. A fast algorithm with an emphasis on computationa
 l efficiency for big data will be introduced. Our method is formulated in 
 a reproducing kernel Hilbert space\, and learning theory of the Bayes risk
  consistency will be developed. In addition\, I will use extensive benchma
 rk data applications to demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of our me
 thod is highly competitive with state-of-the-art classification methods in
 cluding support vector machine\, random forest\, gradient boosting\, and d
 eep neural network.  \n \n
