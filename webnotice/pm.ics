DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Yoav Len\, Department of Combinatorics & Optimizatio
 n\nTitle:   "Baker-DeMarco Learning Seminar: Berkovich spaces" \n\nAbstrac
 t:  Berkovich analytic spaces are a slick way for "filling the holes" in v
 arieties defined over non-Archimedean fields. In the talk\, I will introdu
 ce the analytification construction\, and make the previous sentence more 
 precise. I will explicitly construct the Berkovich line\, and explain how 
 to find the analytification of curves of higher genus. The talk will mostl
 y be informal\, and focus on results and constructions rather than precise
  proofs.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Nick Rollick\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, Univ
 ersity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Grad Student Colloquium -- Mistakes don't ma
 tter: Getting the message without getting the message" \n\nAbstract:  Have
  you ever wondered why a scratched CD still plays properly?  Or why you re
 ceive e-mails without transmission errors?  It's all thanks to some clever
  math!  In this talk\, you will see the coolest-ever application of reduce
 d row echelon form.  You will also learn how basic facts about polynomials
  over finite fields lead to an efficient error-correcting procedure.  Thes
 e so-called Reed-Solomon codes are used in everything from CDs to bar code
 s...  If someone ever asks you what pure math is good for\, now you'll hav
 e a satisfying answer!  \n \n   \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Matthew Harrison-Trainor\, Department of Pure Mathem
 atics\, University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Postdoctoral Seminar: How to kno
 w when you've proved the best possible characterization or classification"
  \n\nAbstract:  Many theorems take the form of a classification -- a\ndesc
 ription of some type of object up to isomorphism -- or a\nclassification -
 - a description of which objects satisfy some additional\nproperty. How do
  you know when such a theorem is as good as possible?\nOne way is to use m
 ethods from computability theory. I'll talk about how\nto use index sets t
 o show that a particular classification or\ncharacterization must be at le
 ast a certain complexity.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Nick Rollick\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, Univ
 ersity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Approximating projective subvarieties" \n\nA
 bstract:  Given an algebraic number\, how well can we approximate it by ra
 tional numbers\, relative to the "complexity" of those rational numbers?  
 Questions of this sort have long preoccupied number theorists.  However\, 
 it was only recently that this question was formulated and studied geometr
 ically.  Identifying numbers with points on the projective line\, the anal
 ogous geometric question is: given a projective variety $X$ and a closed s
 ubvariety $Z$ defined over $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$\, how well can we app
 roximate $Z$ with rational points on $X$\, relative to the "complexity" of
  the points in question?\n In this talk\, I will discuss McKinnon and Roth
 's formulation of this question in terms of "approximation constants" (in 
 the special case where $Z$ is a single point)\, including lower bounds on 
 these constants.  Afterwards\, I will outline a few results of my own\, in
 volving the computation of approximation constants for certain closed subv
 arieties of projective space.  \n \n \n

SUMMARY:Eventually Entanglement Breaking Maps -  (Analysis Seminar Seminar

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Mizanur Rahaman\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, U
 niversity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Eventually Entanglement Breaking Maps" \n
 \nAbstract:  Since its introduction\, the class of entanglement breaking m
 aps played a crucial role in the study of quantum information science and 
 also in the theory of completely positive maps. In this talk\, I will pres
 ent a certain\nclass of linear maps on matrix algebras that have the prope
 rty that they become entanglement breaking after composing finite or infin
 ite number\nof times with themselves. These maps are called eventually ent
 anglement breaking maps. This means that the Choi matrix of the iterated l
 inear map becomes separable in the tensor product space. It turns out that
 \nthe set of eventually entanglement breaking maps forms a rich class with
 in the set of all unital completely positive maps. I will connect these ma
 ps\nwith irreducible positive linear maps which have been studied a lot in
  the non-commutative Perron-Frobenius theory in operator algebra. Various 
 spectral proper-\nties of a ucp map on finite dimensional C*-algebras will
  be discussed. The motivation of this work is the "PPT-squared conjecture"
  made by M. Christandl that says every PPT channel\, when composed with it
 self\, becomes entanglement breaking. In this work\, it is proved that eve
 ry unital PPT-channel becomes entanglement breaking after finite iteration
 s. This is a joint work with Sam Jaques and Vern Paulsen.  \n \n
