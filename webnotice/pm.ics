SUMMARY:Number Theory in Function Fields (Seminar)
LOCATION:MC 5403
DESCRIPTION:Number Theory in Function Fields\nWentang Kuo, Department of Pure Mathematics, University of Waterloo\n\nNumber theory is a branch of pure mathematics devoted\nprimarily to the study of the integers. Integers can be\nconsidered either in themselves, such as properties of\nprime numbers, or as solutions to equations. The quotient\nfield of the ring of polynomials is called the rational function\nfield. As the ring of polynomials over a finite field shares\nsimilar arithmetic properties to the ring of integers,\nmany problems in integers have analogues for polynomials.\nIn this talk, we will use Fermat's last theorem and the\nprime number theorem as examples to discuss their analogues\nin polynomials. Also, in spite of similarities between rational\nnumbers and the rational function field, we will talk about\ndifferences and difficulties arising from problems in these\ntwo settings.BEGIN:VEVENT

SUMMARY:Momentum and Position Forms (Seminar)
LOCATION:MC 5479
DESCRIPTION:Momentum and Position Forms\nJonathan Herman, Department of Pure Mathematics, University of Waterloo\n\nWe first recall the theory of the classical momentum and position functions on the phase space of a manifold. The Poisson bracket relations between these functions form the bridging gap from classical to quantum mechanics. We extend the Poisson bracket to multisymplectic geometry and show that a more general relationship holds between 'momentum and position forms' on an $n$-plectic manifold.BEGIN:VEVENT

SUMMARY:Muchnik and Medvedev Reducibilities (Seminar)
LOCATION:MC 5403
DESCRIPTION:Muchnik and Medvedev Reducibilities\nMohammad Mahmoud, Department of Pure Mathematics, University of Waterloo\n\nEven though both reducibilities seemed to behave in a similar way, we could see (without proof), that they differ at how they get affected by adding a constant to the structures. We give a proof this time and also show in another result that the difference is more than just the reactions to adding constants. The latter result will require a version of the Slaman-Wehner structure.BEGIN:VEVENT

SUMMARY:A new construction of compact G_2~manifolds by glueing Eguchi-Hanson spaces, Part II: Modifying the identification with the normal bundle (Seminar)
LOCATION:MC 5479
DESCRIPTION:A new construction of compact G_2~manifolds by glueing Eguchi-Hanson spaces, Part II: Modifying the identification with the normal bundle\nSpiro Karigiannis, Department of Pure Mathematics, University of Waterloo\n\nThis is the second in a series of talks, where I will go through the details of my new construction with Dominic Joyce of smooth compact $G_2$~manifolds by glueing families of Eguchi-Hanson spaces. In fact, this glueing involves three pieces, rather than two, and two of the three pieces \emph{do not} admit natural torsion-free $G_2$~structures, which makes the construction much more complicated than the only other existing constructions, by Joyce (1994) and by Kovalev/Corti-Haskins-Nordstr\"om-Pacini (2003/2012). In the second talk, I will discuss both modifying the connection on the normal bundle and the exponential map, in order to kill the leading errors in the torsion on the middle glueing piece. If time permits we will discuss the next major component of the construction, namely the fibre-wise blow up of the orbifold to obtain a family of topologically Eguchi-Hanson spaces.
