DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  John Sawatzky\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, Uni
 versity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Ultraproducts and some loose ends" \n\nAbst
 ract:  We'll complete the metric ultraproduct construction\, and show that
  a sofic group embeds in an ultraproduct of symmetric groups equipped with
  the Hamming distance. If possible we'll tie up some of the loose ends fro
 m last time\, e.g. the dependence on that constant $r$\, and residually fi
 nite groups.  \n \n  \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Boris Khesin\, University of Toronto\nTitle:   "Inte
 grability and non-integrability in pentagram maps" \n\nRemarks:  Refreshme
 nts will be served in MC 5403 at 3:30pm.  \n\nAbstract:  We define pentagr
 am maps on polygons in any dimension\, which extend R. Schwartz's definiti
 on of the 2D pentagram map. Many of those maps turn out to be discrete int
 egrable dynamical systems\, while the corresponding continuous limits of s
 uch maps coincide with equations of the KdV hierarchy\, generalizing the B
 oussinesq equation in 2D. We discuss their geometry\, Lax forms\, and inte
 rrelations between recent pentagram generalizations. This is a joint work 
 with F. Soloviev.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Jeffrey Shallit\, David R. Cheriton School of Comput
 er Science\, University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Waring's theorem for binary
  k'th powers and palindromes" \n\nAbstract:  Recently there has been some 
 interest in analogues of Waring's theorem for other kinds of sets analogou
 s to powers of integers.  For example\, Banks proved that every natural nu
 mber is the sum of at most 49 numbers whose base-10 expansion is a palindr
 ome\, and this was improved to 3 for all bases $b \\ge 5$ by Cilleruelo\, 
 Luca\, and Baster.\n In this talk I will discuss some recent results about
  palindromes in bases 2\, 3\, 4 and binary k'th powers. (A binary k'th pow
 er is an integer whose base-2 expansion consists of k consecutive identica
 l blocks.) In particular\, I'll show that for all $k \\ge 1$ there exists 
 a constant W(k) such that every sufficiently large multiple of $\\gcd(k\, 
 2^k - 1)$ is the sum of W(k) binary k'th  powers.\n This is joint work wit

 ics\, University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Finite and integral morphisms" \n\
 nAbstract:  We will continue studying properties of finite and integral mo
 rphisms. We will use properties of algebra homomorphisms to prove that fin
 ite morphisms have finite fibers and that they are affine local on the tar
 get. We will also prove that integral morphisms are closed and we will stu
 dy some examples. Time permitting we will introduce morphisms (locally) of
  finite type.  \n \n  \n

 ersity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "An Introduction to Quantum Graphs\, Chromati
 c Numbers and Lovász Inequalties" \n\nAbstract:  Joint Pure Math/C&O Grad
 uate Student Colloquium\n Quantum graph theory\, also known as non-commuta
 tive graph theory\, is an operator system generalization of graph theory. 
 Quantum graphs were first used to extend the notion of one-shot-zero-error
  capacity of a "Noisy Channel" to "Quantum Channels" .  In this talk we go
  over some of this original motivation  and generalize several key graph t
 heory parameters. We will also look at attempts made to define the complem
 ent of a Quantum graph and generalize the famous Lovász inequality.  \n \

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Chris Schafhauser\, Department of Pure Mathematics\,
  University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "An Embedding Theorem for C*-algebras" \
 n\nAbstract:  A C*-algebra consists of an algebra of bounded linear operat
 ors acting on a Hilbert space which is closed the adjoint operation (rough
 ly\, the transpose) and is complete in a certain metric.  Typical examples
  include the ring of $n \\times n$ complex matrices and the ring C(X) of r
 epresentation of continuous functions from a compact space X to the comple
 x numbers.  Many more interesting examples arise from various dynamical ob
 jects (e.g. group and group actions) and from various geometric/topologica
 l constructions.\n The structure of finite dimensional C*-algebras is well
  understood: they are finite direct sums of complex matrix algebras.  The 
 class of approximately finite-dimensional (AF) C*-algebras\, ones which ma
 y be written as (the closure of) an increasing union of finite-dimensional
  subalgebras\, are also well understood: they are determined up to isomorp
 hism by their module structure.   However\, the class of sub-algebras of A
 F-algebras is still rather mysterious\; it includes\, for instance\, all c
 ommutative C*-algebras and all C*-algebras generated by amenable groups.  
 It is a long-standing problem to find an abstract characterization of suba
 lgebras of AF-algebras.\n I will discuss this class of algebras and a rece
 nt partial answer to this AF-Embedding problem.  My goal is to keep the ta
 lk accessible and mostly expository.  In particular\, I won't assume any p
 rior knowledge of operator algebras or functional analysis.  \n \n    \n

 "Ultraproducts and congruence distributive varieties - Part 2" \n\nAbstrac
 t:  I shall prove that the class of subdirectly irreducible algebras in a 
 congruence distributive variety V generated by a class K is contained in t
 he class obtained by taking the closures under S (subalgebras) and H (homo
 morphisms) of the class of all ultraproducts over K.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Sam Kim\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, Universit
 y of Waterloo\nTitle:   "On Synchronous Quantum Games" \n\nAbstract:  We w
 ill discuss the notion of synchronous quantum games. Unlike general quantu
 m games\, synchronous games have the advantage of having a purely C*-algeb
 raic characterization of their correlation sets but still retain the full 
 strength of its not necessarily synchronous counterpart. We will talk abou
 t how different models of physical systems are distinguished using synchro
 nous games and how the distinguishing of two synchronous correlation sets 
 relates to Connes' embedding problem.  \n \n
