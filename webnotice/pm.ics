DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Michael Deveau\,\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, U
 niversity of WaterlooTitle: "Computable Functors and Effective Interpret
 ability"\nAbstract: We introduce the notion of a computable functor and 
 the definition of effective inter- pretability. The former is a computable
  analogue of a category-theoretic functor between ω-presentations of stru
 ctures\, and the latter is an effective version of model-theoretic inter- 
 pretability. We show that effective interpretations induce computable func
 tors\, and briefly mention the converse. \n\n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Stephen Wen\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, Univer
 sity of WaterlooTitle: "Applications of the zeta function over function 
 fields."\nAbstract: We provide a proof of the Prime Number Theorem over 
 function fields. We examine and extend techniques used in a zeta function 
 proof of the theorem to other applications such as counting square- and hi
 gher power- free polynomials of a given degree. If time permits\, Dirichle
 t Series will be in- troduced with an aim towards proving the analogue of 
 Dirichlets Theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions. \n\n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Anthony McCormick\,\, Department of Pure Mathematics\
 , University of WaterlooTitle: "The Spencer Complex Part 3"\nAbstract:
  We will begin our construction of resolutions of the sheaf kernel of a li
 near partial differential operator between vector bundles. Furthermore\, w
 e will discuss some of the connections and interpretations of these resolu
 tions in terms of deformation theory\, and outline how they can be applied
  to the integrability problem for G-structures. \n\n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Vilmos Komornik\, University of StrasbourgTitle: "Top
 ological and fractal properties of non-integer base expansions"\nAbstract:
  Given a base 1\\less q\\le 2\, following Renyi (1957) we consider expansi
 ons of the form\nx=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{c_i}{q^i}\nwith digits $c_i
 $ belonging to $\\{0\,1\\}$.\nIn case $q=2$ of the familiar binary expansi
 ons every $x\\in [0\,1]$ has an expansion\, and this is unique except the 
 dyadic rational numbers that have two expansions. \nThe case $1We determin
 e the values of $q$ for which $U_q$ is closed or even a Cantor set. \nThes
 e values have unexpected number-theoretical properties.\nMoreover\, we det
 ermine the Hausdorff dimension of the sets $U_q$.\nIt turns out to depend 
 on $q$ in a quite intricate way.\nOur survey is mostly based on joint rese
 arch with P. Erd{\\H o}s\, I. Jo\\'o\, P. Loreti\, M. de Vries\, D. Kong a
 nd W. Li. \n\n   \n

 University of WaterlooTitle: "A new construction of compact G2 manifolds
  by glueing Eguchi-Hanson spaces\, Part III: Fibrewise blow-up by a family
  of Eguchi-Hanson spaces"\nAbstract: We move on to the second of four ma
 in steps of the construction: resolving the orbifold singularities by perf
 orming a fibre-wise blow up. The important point is that there is no natur
 al torsion-free G2 structure on this third glueing region. The natural G2 
 structure is not even closed. There is a natural way to correct it to be c
 losed\, which we will discuss. The third step is correcting this further t
 o remove the leading error term in the torsion\, which is the third main s
 tep. \n\n
