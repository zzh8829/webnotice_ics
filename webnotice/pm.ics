DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Letian Chen\, University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Appl
 ications of the Riemann-Roch Theorem" \n\nAbstract:  We will continue from
  last time and state the Riemann-Roch\ntheorem after recalling some key de
 finitions and results. We will then use\nthe Riemann-Roch theorem to give 
 a characterization of function fields of\ngenus 0 and show the finiteness 
 of the class group.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Tyrone Ghaswala\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, U
 niversity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "The liftable mapping class group" \n\nAbs
 tract:  This thesis studies a subgroup of the mapping class group related 
 to a covering space\, called the liftable mapping class group.  This thesi
 s covers the following results.  A classification of cyclic branched cover
 s of the sphere with the property that the liftable mapping class group co
 incides with the entire mapping class group.  Group presentations for the 
 liftable mapping class group corresponding to a family of cyclic branched 
 covers of the sphere called the balanced superelliptic covers\, and a fami
 ly of cyclic branched covers of the torus.  A characterisation of the lift
 able mapping class group for surfaces with boundary.  \n \n   \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Jonny Stephenson\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, 
 University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Effective bi-interpretability and Graphs
  II" \n\nAbstract:  Last time we saw that every structure is effectively b
 i-interpretable with a structure over a simple language consisting of a un
 ary predicate U and a symmetric binary predicate E. This week\, we will sh
 ow that any structure over this language is effectively bi-interpretable w
 ith a graph. This will complete the proof that every structure is effectiv
 ely bi-interpretable with a graph.  \n \n  \n
