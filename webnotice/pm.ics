DESCRIPTION:Number Theory in Function Fields\nWentang Kuo\, Department of 
 Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\nNumber theory is a branch of pu
 re mathematics devoted\nprimarily to the study of the integers. Integers c
 an be\nconsidered either in themselves\, such as properties of\nprime numb
 ers\, or as solutions to equations. The quotient\nfield of the ring of pol
 ynomials is called the rational function\nfield. As the ring of polynomial
 s over a finite field shares\nsimilar arithmetic properties to the ring of
  integers\,\nmany problems in integers have analogues for polynomials.\nIn
  this talk\, we will use Fermat's last theorem and the\nprime number theor
 em as examples to discuss their analogues\nin polynomials. Also\, in spite
  of similarities between rational\nnumbers and the rational function field
 \, we will talk about\ndifferences and difficulties arising from problems 
 in these\ntwo settings.

DESCRIPTION:Momentum and Position Forms\nJonathan Herman\, Department of P
 ure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\nWe first recall the theory of th
 e classical momentum and position functions on the phase space of a manifo
 ld. The Poisson bracket relations between these functions form the bridgin
 g gap from classical to quantum mechanics. We extend the Poisson bracket t
 o multisymplectic geometry and show that a more general relationship holds
  between 'momentum and position forms' on an $n$-plectic manifold.

DESCRIPTION:Muchnik and Medvedev Reducibilities\nMohammad Mahmoud\, Depart
 ment of Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\nEven though both reduci
 bilities seemed to behave in a similar way\, we could see (without proof)\
 , that they differ at how they get affected by adding a constant to the st
 ructures. We give a proof this time and also show in another result that t
 he difference is more than just the reactions to adding constants. The lat
 ter result will require a version of the Slaman-Wehner structure.

DESCRIPTION:A new construction of compact G_2~manifolds by glueing Eguchi-
 Hanson spaces\, Part II: Modifying the identification with the normal bund
 le\nSpiro Karigiannis\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, University of Wat
 erloo\nThis is the second in a series of talks\, where I will go through t
 he details of my new construction with Dominic Joyce of smooth compact $G_
 2$~manifolds by glueing families of Eguchi-Hanson spaces. In fact\, this g
 lueing involves three pieces\, rather than two\, and two of the three piec
 es \\emph{do not} admit natural torsion-free $G_2$~structures\, which make
 s the construction much more complicated than the only other existing cons
 tructions\, by Joyce (1994) and by Kovalev/Corti-Haskins-Nordstr\\"om-Paci
 ni (2003/2012). In the second talk\, I will discuss both modifying the con
 nection on the normal bundle and the exponential map\, in order to kill th
 e leading errors in the torsion on the middle glueing piece. If time permi
 ts we will discuss the next major component of the construction\, namely t
 he fibre-wise blow up of the orbifold to obtain a family of topologically 
 Eguchi-Hanson spaces.
