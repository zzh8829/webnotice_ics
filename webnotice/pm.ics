DESCRIPTION:Computable Functors and Effective Interpretability\nMichae
 l Deveau\,\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\npm\n
 Computability Learning Seminar\n\n\nWe introduce the notion of a computabl
 e functor and the definition of effective inter- pretability. The former i
 s a computable analogue of a category-theoretic functor between ω-present
 ations of structures\, and the latter is an effective version of model-the
 oretic inter- pretability. We show that effective interpretations induce c
 omputable functors\, and briefly mention the converse.

 tephen Wen\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\npm\n
 Student Number Theory Seminars Seminar\n\n\nWe provide a proof of the Prim
 e Number Theorem over function fields. We examine and extend techniques us
 ed in a zeta function proof of the theorem to other applications such as c
 ounting square- and higher power- free polynomials of a given degree. If t
 ime permits\, Dirichlet Series will be in- troduced with an aim towards pr
 oving the analogue of Dirichlets Theorem on primes in arithmetic progressi
 ons.

 nt of Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\npm\nGeometry Working Semi
 nar\n\n\nWe will begin our construction of resolutions of the sheaf kernel
  of a linear partial differential operator between vector bundles. Further
 more\, we will discuss some of the connections and interpretations of thes
 e resolutions in terms of deformation theory\, and outline how they can be
  applied to the integrability problem for G-structures.

 -Hanson spaces\, Part III: Fibrewise blow-up by a family of Eguchi-Hanson 
 spaces\nSpiro Karigiannis\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, University 
 of Waterloo\npm\nGeometry Working Seminar\n\n\nWe move on to the second of
  four main steps of the construction: resolving the orbifold singularities
  by performing a fibre-wise blow up. The important point is that there is 
 no natural torsion-free G2 structure on this third glueing region. The nat
 ural G2 structure is not even closed. There is a natural way to correct it
  to be closed\, which we will discuss. The third step is correcting this f
 urther to remove the leading error term in the torsion\, which is the thir
 d main step.
