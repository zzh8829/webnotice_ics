DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  David Tweedle\, The University of the West Indies\nT
 itle:   "Artin's conjecture on primitive roots and function field analogue
 s" \n\nAbstract:  Recall Artin's primitive root conjecture\, which states 
 that if\n\\(a\\) is not \\(-1\\) or a square then the reduction of \\(a\\)
  modulo \\(p\\)\ngenerates the multiplicative group of the integers modulo
  \\(p\\) for\ninfinitely many primes \\(p\\).  We will examine the similar
 ities and\ndifferences between Artin's conjecture and some natural analogu
 es for\nelliptic curves and function fields.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Pantelis Eleftheriou\, University of Konstanz\nTitle
 :   "Small sets in dense pairs" \n\nAbstract:  Let (M\, P) be an expansion
  of an o-minimal structure M by a\ndense subset P of M\, such that three t
 ameness conditions hold. We prove\nthat the induced structure on P by M el
 iminates imaginaries. As a\ncorollary\, we obtain that every small set X d
 efinable in M can be\ndefinably embedded into some P^n\, uniformly in para
 meters. We then verify\nthe tameness conditions in three examples: dense p
 airs\, expansions of M by\na dense independent set\, and expansions by a d
 ense divisible\nmultiplicative group with the Mann property.  \n \n  \n

 tract:  Many of us have heard that there is some sort of relationship betw
 een Ricci flow and renormalization group flow in QFT. The goal of this tal
 k/discussion will be to try and understand this relationship.  \n \n \n

 iversity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Effective Bi-interpretability -- Part 2" \
 n\nAbstract:  We continue exploring the properties of effective bi-interpr
 etability introduced last time. We shall see that two structures being eff
 ectively bi-interpetable requires that they have very similar properties i
 n terms of many of the notions discussed thus far.  \n \n \n

SUMMARY:Contributions to the Theory of Radicals for Noncommutative Rings -

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Blake Madill\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, Univ
 ersity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Contributions to the Theory of Radicals for 
 Noncommutative Rings" \n\nAbstract:  We consider several radical classes o
 f noncommutative rings. In particular\, we provide new results regarding t
 he radical theory of semigroup-graded rings\, monomial algebras\, and Ore 
 extensions of derivation type. \n In Chapter 2 it is shown that every ring
  graded by a torsion free nilpotent group has a homogeneous upper nilradic
 al. Moreover\, we show that a ring graded by unique-product semigroup will
  be semiprime only when it has no nonzero nilpotent homogeneous ideals. Th
 is provides a graded-analogue of the classical result that says a ring is 
 semiprime if and only if it has no nonzero nilpotent ideals. \n In Chapter
  3\, the class of iterative algebras are introduced. Iterative algebras se
 rve as an interesting class of monomial algebras where ring theoretical in
 formation may be determined from combinatorial information of an associate
 d right-infinite word. We use these monomial algebras to construct an exam
 ple of a prime\, semiprimitive\, graded-nilpotent algebra of Gelfand-Kiril
 lov dimension 2 which is finitely generated as a Lie algebra. \n In Chapte
 r 4\, the Jacobson radical of Ore extensions of derivation type is discuss
 ed. We show that if $R$ is a locally nilpotent ring which satisfies a poly
 nomial identity then any Ore extension of $R$ of derivation type will also
  be locally nilpotent. Finally\, we show that the Jacobson radical of any 
 Ore extension of derivation type of a polynomial identity ring will have a
  nil coefficient ring.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Nickolas Rollick\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, 
 University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Scheming with my associates" \n\nAbstrac
 t:  By now\, we have seen a bewildering number of adjectives that might be
  attached to a scheme\, some of which are topological in nature\, some of 
 which are algebraic in nature\, and some of which refer to all the structu
 ral properties of the scheme at once.  To get our bearings\, we will start
  by recalling all the important adjectives discussed so far and categorize
  them.  Then\, we move to the topic of associated points\, first looking a
 t them in the context of finitely generated modules over a Noetherian ring
 .  Time permitting\, we will discuss associated points of locally Noetheri
 an schemes as well and see how they can be used to define rational functio
 ns on such schemes.  \n \n  \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Anthony McCormick\, Department of Pure Mathematics\,
  University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Grad Student Colloquium: Physics for Ma
 thematicians" \n\nAbstract:  What is Newton really saying when he writes $
 F=ma$? We know the $a$ stands for acceleration but the acceleration of wha
 t? The $F$ is supposed to be the total force acting on the system but what
  precisely is meant by "force"? What is a "mechanical system"? What does N
 ewton mean by an "inertial reference frame"? What is space? Time? I'll att
 empt to answer these questions in a way satisfactory for mathematicians. F
 urthermore\, if time permits\, I'll try to explain some of the ideas behin
 d modern physics and how mathematicians can extract mathematically relevan
 t ideas from physics talks.  \n \n
