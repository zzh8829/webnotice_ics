DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Andriy Haydys\, University of Freiburg\nTitle:   "G2
  instantons and the Seiberg-Witten monopoles" \n\nAbstract:  G2 manifolds 
 constitute a class of Einstein seven-manifolds and are of substantial inte
 rest both in Riemannian geometry and theoretical physics. At present a vas
 t number of compact G2 manifolds is known to exist. In this talk I will di
 scuss a gauge-theoretic approach to the construction of invariants of comp
 act G2 manifolds. I will focus on an interplay between gauge theories in d
 imensions 7 and 3 and how this can be used for the construction of the inv
 ariants.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Rahim Moosa\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, Unive
 rsity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "o-minimal GAGA Seminar: Introduction" \n\nAbs
 tract:  This term some of us will be working through sections 2 and 3 (and
   maybe 4?) of a recent paper of Bakker-Brunebarbe-Tsimerman in which a de
 finable version of Serre's GAGA is developed (and then applied to solve an
  old problem of Griffiths). It is a kind of compromise between algebraic g
 eometry and local complex analytic geometry facilitated by model theory (i
 t seems to involve very little of the last).\n In this first meeting I wil
 l introduce the notions of "structure" and "o-minimality" on the reals\, a
 s background preparation for starting to read the paper.  \n \n    \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Tobias Fritz\, Perimeter Institute\nTitle:   "A sepa
 ration theorem for order unit modules\, with applications to random walks 
 and the Laplace transform" \n\nAbstract:  I will introduce order unit modu
 les over ordered commutative\n$\\mathbb{R}$-algebras. I will then state th
 e moment problem for order\nunit modules\, and present a very general solu
 tion. This solution\ninvolves a certain locally convex topology which spec
 ializes to the\ntopology of compact convergence in the case of a polynomia
 l ring.\nDualizing this solution of the moment problem gives a separation 
 theorem\nwhich specializes to the Hahn-Banach theorem for order unit space
 s in\nthe case where the algebra is $\\mathbb{R}$\, and to a Positivstelle
 nsatz\nin the case where the module coincides with the algebra. In the cas
 e of\na suitable algebra of measures under convolution\, these results als
 o\nspecialize to characterizations of Laplace transforms and to a new\nthe
 orem on the asymptotic comparison of random walks.  \n \n       \n

 stract:  Unlike for the classical Seiberg-Witten equation\, the moduli spa
 ce of the Seiberg-Witten equation with multiple spinors may be non-compact
 . The boundary in this case is modelled on the Seiberg-Witten monopoles wi
 th a singularity along a codimension two subset\, which is referred to as 
 a blow up set. The purpose of this talk is to discuss a lower bound for th
 e 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure of the blow up set when the base manifol
 d is of dimension three.  \n \n    \n

 niversity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "On basic and Bass quaternion orders" \n\n
 Abstract:  Quaternion orders can possess many different ring-theoretical\n
 properties\, such as being maximal\, hereditary\, Eichler\, Bass\, or\nGor
 enstein. I will recall these properties and their relations to\neach other
 \, summarizing a 'taxonomy' of quaternion orders. A\nquaternion order O ov
 er a domain R is basic if it contains an\nintegrally closed quadratic R-or
 der. I will show that a quaternion\norder is Bass if and only if it is bas
 ic\, in the local and global\nsettings.\n This is joint work with Sara Cha
 ri and John Voight.  \n \n    \n

 cs\, University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Grad Student Colloquium: Cryptograp
 hic primitives and applications" \n\nAbstract:  Modern computers and the i
 nternet rely heavily on cryptography to keep our communications and machin
 es safe from malicious parties\; in fact\, much of this cryptography is im
 plemented using elementary algebra. In this talk\, I will present three cr
 yptographic primitives (symmetric encryption\, public key encryption\, and
  digital signatures)\, describe how one might construct instances of these
  primitives\, and give an idea of how they are used in modern computing. T
 ime permitting I will cover a fourth cryptographic primitive: secret shari
 ng schemes.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Guy Salomon\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, Unive
 rsity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Hyperrigid subsets of CuntzKrieger algebras
  and the property of rigidity at zero" \n\nAbstract:  A generating set of 
 a C*-algebra is said to be hyperrigid if for every faithful nondegenerate 
 *-representation of the C*-algebra on a Hilbert space H\, every sequence o
 f unital completely positive self maps of B(H) that converges to the ident
 ity on the generating set\, converges to the identity on the whole C*-alge
 bra (all convergences are in the pointwise-norm sense). I will show that i
 nside the CuntzKrieger algebra of a row-finite directed graph with no is
 olated vertices\, the set of all edge partial-isometries is hyperrigid. I 
 will also present\, both in general and in the graph context\, a related p
 roperty called rigidity at zero that sheds light on the phenomenon of hype
 rrigidity.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Mohammad Mahmoud\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, 
 University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "The Isomorphism Problem for Pregeometrie
 s" \n\nAbstract:  We will talk about the isomorphism problem for classes o
 f r.i.c.e.  pregeometries. By a r.i.c.e. pregeometry we mean a computable 
 structure $\\mathcal{M}$ equipped with a r.i.c.e.  operator $cl^{\\mathcal
 {M}}$ such that $(\\mathcal{M}\,cl^{\\mathcal{M}})$ is a pregeometry. The 
 operator $cl^{\\mathcal{M}}$ is called r.i.c.e. (relatively intrinsically 
 computably enumerable)  if for every computable copy $(\\mathcal{N}\,cl^{\
 \mathcal{N}})$ of $(\\mathcal{M}\,cl^{\\mathcal{M}})$\, $cl^{\\mathcal{N}}
 $ is c.e. in $\\mathcal{N}$. We will show that if $K$ is a class of r.i.c.
 e. pregeometries in which dependent elements are dense\, then the isomorph
 ism problem for the class $K$ is $\\Pi^0_3$-hard.  \n \n     \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Ross Willard\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, Univ
 ersity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Dualizing structures that are necessarily of
  infinite signature" \n\nAbstract:  Many classical dualities\, such as Sto
 ne duality for Boolean algebras and Priestley duality for distributive lat
 tices\, are mediated by a schizophrenic pair consisting of a finite al
 gebra generating the algebraic category together with a topological struct
 ure having the same universe as\, and compatible with\, the finite generat
 ing algebra.  For example\, the schizophrenic pair for Stone duality consi
 sts of the 2-element Boolean algebra together with the 2-element set viewe
 d as a discrete space\, while the schizophrenic pair for Priestley duality
  consists of the 2-element distributive lattice together with the 2-elemen
 t total order (again viewed as a discrete space).  A long-standing open pr
 oblem in the field of natural dualities asked if every schizophrenic pair 
 is equivalent to one in which the topological structure has only finitely 
 many operations and relations in its signature.\n This problem was finally
  solved by Jane Pitkethly in 2011.  In this talk I will describe the schiz
 ophrenic pairs that she constructed for this purpose and begin their analy
 sis.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Patrick Speissegger\, McMaster University\nTitle:   
 "Limit cycles of planar vector fields\, Hilberts 16th problem and o-mini
 mality" \n\nAbstract:  Recent work links certain aspects of the second par
 t of\nHilberts 16th problem (H16) to the theory of o-minimality.  One of
 \nthese aspects is the generation and destruction of limit cycles in\nfami
 lies of planar vector fields\, commonly referred to as\nbifurcations. 
  I will outline the significance of bifurcations for H16\nand explain how 
 logicin particular\, o-minimalitycan be used to\nunderstand them well 
 enough to be able to count limit cycles.  \n \n     \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Siddharth Mathur\, University of Arizona\nTitle:   "
 Azumaya Algebras and the Resolution Property" \n\nAbstract:  Azumaya algeb
 ras\, are (etale) twisted forms of matrix rings. These objects are of grea
 t utility because they give rise to Brauer classes. Fifty years ago\, Grot
 hendieck asked whether every cohomological Brauer class has a correspondin
 g Azumaya algebra. This question is still open even for smooth separated t
 hreefolds over the complex numbers!\nOne says a scheme (or Algebraic stack
 ) X satisfies the resolution property if every coherent sheaf is the quoti
 ent of a vector bundle. The work of Totaro and Gross explains that this pr
 operty holds iff X admits a very special quotient stack presentation. Howe
 ver\, whether or not separated Algebraic stacks have this property remains
  a difficult question.\n The goal of our talk will be to explain\n (1) Why
  these two questions are deeply intertwined\,\n (2) New results regarding 
 the existence of Azumaya Algebras and\n (3) How we can use results as in (
 2) to show large classes of algebraic stacks satisfy the resolution proper
 ty.  \n \n
