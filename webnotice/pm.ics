DESCRIPTION:Computable Functors and Effective Interpretability\nMichae
 l Deveau\,\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\n\nWe
  introduce the notion of a computable functor and the definition of effect
 ive inter- pretability. The former is a computable analogue of a category-
 theoretic functor between ω-presentations of structures\, and the latter 
 is an effective version of model-theoretic inter- pretability. We show tha
 t effective interpretations induce computable functors\, and briefly menti
 on the converse.

DESCRIPTION:Applications of the zeta function over function fields.\nS
 tephen Wen\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\n\nWe
  provide a proof of the Prime Number Theorem over function fields. We exam
 ine and extend techniques used in a zeta function proof of the theorem to 
 other applications such as counting square- and higher power- free polynom
 ials of a given degree. If time permits\, Dirichlet Series will be in- tro
 duced with an aim towards proving the analogue of Dirichlets Theorem on pr
 imes in arithmetic progressions.

DESCRIPTION:The Spencer Complex Part 3\nAnthony McCormick\,\, Departme
 nt of Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\n\nWe will begin our const
 ruction of resolutions of the sheaf kernel of a linear partial differentia
 l operator between vector bundles. Furthermore\, we will discuss some of t
 he connections and interpretations of these resolutions in terms of deform
 ation theory\, and outline how they can be applied to the integrability pr
 oblem for G-structures.

 -Hanson spaces\, Part III: Fibrewise blow-up by a family of Eguchi-Hanson 
 spaces\nSpiro Karigiannis\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, University 
 of Waterloo\n\nWe move on to the second of four main steps of the construc
 tion: resolving the orbifold singularities by performing a fibre-wise blow
  up. The important point is that there is no natural torsion-free G2 struc
 ture on this third glueing region. The natural G2 structure is not even cl
 osed. There is a natural way to correct it to be closed\, which we will di
 scuss. The third step is correcting this further to remove the leading err
 or term in the torsion\, which is the third main step.
