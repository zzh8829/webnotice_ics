DESCRIPTION:Number Theory in Function Fields\nWentang Kuo\, Department of 
 Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\n\nNumber theory is a branch of 
 pure mathematics devoted\nprimarily to the study of the integers. Integers
  can be\nconsidered either in themselves\, such as properties of\nprime nu
 mbers\, or as solutions to equations. The quotient\nfield of the ring of p
 olynomials is called the rational function\nfield. As the ring of polynomi
 als over a finite field shares\nsimilar arithmetic properties to the ring 
 of integers\,\nmany problems in integers have analogues for polynomials.\n
 In this talk\, we will use Fermat's last theorem and the\nprime number the
 orem as examples to discuss their analogues\nin polynomials. Also\, in spi
 te of similarities between rational\nnumbers and the rational function fie
 ld\, we will talk about\ndifferences and difficulties arising from problem
 s in these\ntwo settings.

DESCRIPTION:Momentum and Position Forms\nJonathan Herman\, Department of P
 ure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\n\nWe first recall the theory of 
 the classical momentum and position functions on the phase space of a mani
 fold. The Poisson bracket relations between these functions form the bridg
 ing gap from classical to quantum mechanics. We extend the Poisson bracket
  to multisymplectic geometry and show that a more general relationship hol
 ds between 'momentum and position forms' on an $n$-plectic manifold.

DESCRIPTION:Muchnik and Medvedev Reducibilities\nMohammad Mahmoud\, Depart
 ment of Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\n\nEven though both redu
 cibilities seemed to behave in a similar way\, we could see (without proof
 )\, that they differ at how they get affected by adding a constant to the 
 structures. We give a proof this time and also show in another result that
  the difference is more than just the reactions to adding constants. The l
 atter result will require a version of the Slaman-Wehner structure.

DESCRIPTION:A new construction of compact G_2~manifolds by glueing Eguchi-
 Hanson spaces\, Part II: Modifying the identification with the normal bund
 le\nSpiro Karigiannis\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, University of Wat
 erloo\n\nThis is the second in a series of talks\, where I will go through
  the details of my new construction with Dominic Joyce of smooth compact $
 G_2$~manifolds by glueing families of Eguchi-Hanson spaces. In fact\, this
  glueing involves three pieces\, rather than two\, and two of the three pi
 eces \\emph{do not} admit natural torsion-free $G_2$~structures\, which ma
 kes the construction much more complicated than the only other existing co
 nstructions\, by Joyce (1994) and by Kovalev/Corti-Haskins-Nordstr\\"om-Pa
 cini (2003/2012). In the second talk\, I will discuss both modifying the c
 onnection on the normal bundle and the exponential map\, in order to kill 
 the leading errors in the torsion on the middle glueing piece. If time per
 mits we will discuss the next major component of the construction\, namely
  the fibre-wise blow up of the orbifold to obtain a family of topologicall
 y Eguchi-Hanson spaces.
