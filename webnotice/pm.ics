DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Michael Deveau\,\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, 
 University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Computable Functors and Effective Inte
 rpretability" \n\nAbstract:  We introduce the notion of a computable fun
 ctor and the definition of effective inter- pretability. The former is a c
 omputable analogue of a category-theoretic functor between ω-presentation
 s of structures\, and the latter is an effective version of model-theoreti
 c inter- pretability. We show that effective interpretations induce comput
 able functors\, and briefly mention the converse.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Stephen Wen\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, Unive
 rsity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Applications of the zeta function over func
 tion fields." \n\nAbstract:  We provide a proof of the Prime Number Theo
 rem over function fields. We examine and extend techniques used in a zeta 
 function proof of the theorem to other applications such as counting squar
 e- and higher power- free polynomials of a given degree. If time permits\,
  Dirichlet Series will be in- troduced with an aim towards proving the ana
 logue of Dirichlets Theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions.  \n \n \

 bstract:  We will begin our construction of resolutions of the sheaf kerne
 l of a linear partial differential operator between vector bundles. Furthe
 rmore\, we will discuss some of the connections and interpretations of the
 se resolutions in terms of deformation theory\, and outline how they can b
 e applied to the integrability problem for G-structures.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Vilmos Komornik\, University of Strasbourg\nTitle:  
  "Topological and fractal properties of non-integer base expansions" \n\nA
 bstract:  Given a base 1\\less q\\le 2\, following Renyi (1957) we conside
 r expansions of the form\n x=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{c_i}{q^i}\n with 
 digits $c_i$ belonging to $\\{0\,1\\}$.\nIn case $q=2$ of the familiar bin
 ary expansions every $x\\in [0\,1]$ has an expansion\, and this is unique 
 except the dyadic rational numbers that have two expansions. \n The case $
 1 We determine the values of $q$ for which $U_q$ is closed or even a Canto
 r set. \nThese values have unexpected number-theoretical properties.\nMore
 over\, we determine the Hausdorff dimension of the sets $U_q$.\nIt turns o
 ut to depend on $q$ in a quite intricate way.\n Our survey is mostly based
  on joint research with P. Erd{\\H o}s\, I. Jo\\'o\, P. Loreti\, M. de Vri
 es\, D. Kong and W. Li.  \n \n   \n

  University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "A new construction of compact G2 mani
 folds by glueing Eguchi-Hanson spaces\, Part III: Fibrewise blow-up by a f
 amily of Eguchi-Hanson spaces" \n\nAbstract:  We move on to the second o
 f four main steps of the construction: resolving the orbifold singularitie
 s by performing a fibre-wise blow up. The important point is that there is
  no natural torsion-free G2 structure on this third glueing region. The na
 tural G2 structure is not even closed. There is a natural way to correct i
 t to be closed\, which we will discuss. The third step is correcting this 
 further to remove the leading error term in the torsion\, which is the thi
 rd main step.  \n \n
