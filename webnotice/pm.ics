DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Stephen Wen\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, Unive
 rsity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "An analog of Sarkozy's theorem on squares in 
 difference sets" \n\nAbstract:  We will follow a paper by Yu-Ru Liu and Th
 ai Hoang\nLe in which we examine the difference sets of subsets of\n$\\mat
 hbb{F}_q[t]$. We will find a sufficient condition on the density of a\nsub
 set $A$ in the set of polynomials of degree strictly less than $N$\,\ndeno
 ted $\\mathbb{G}_N$\, so that $A-A$ must contain a perfect square. We\nwil
 l do this by bounding the density of sets $A$ such that $A-A$ has no\nperf
 ect square. We will use the polynomial Hardy-Littlewood circle method\nalo
 ng with density increment technology developed by Pintz\, Steiger\, and\nS
 zemeredi.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Adam Dor On\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, Unive
 rsity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Techniques in operator algebras: Classificati
 on\, dilations and   non-commutative boundaries" \n\nAbstract:  In this ta
 lk we will see various techniques in operator  \nalgebras and operator sys
 tems. We begin with classification of  \nnon-self-adjoint and self-adjoint
  operator algebras constructed from  \ncertain Markov chains. We then tran
 sition to the study of  \nnon-commutative boundaries in the sense of Arves
 on\, and use them to  \nget interesting dilation results for families of o
 perators associated  \nto directed graphs. Finally\, we discuss connection
 s between operator  \nsystems\, matrix convex sets and dilation theory\, a
 nd use them to  \nobtain scaled inclusion results for matrix convex sets.

 atics\, University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Computable Categoricity" \n\nAbs
 tract:  We will continue our discussion of computable categoricity by char
 acterizing it for structures with some amount of decidability\, and then s
 eparating it from relative computable categoricity.  \n \n   \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Jaspar Wiart\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, Univ
 ersity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Four Years in Thirty Minutes" \n\nAbstract: 
  In my four years at UW I completed two research projects. For the first p
 roject I computed the C*-envelopes of a family of isometric semicrossed pr
 oducts arising from number theory. In the second I characterized the Jacob
 son radical of certain semicrossed products of simple unital C*-algebras w
 ith sufficiently nice semigroups. In this talk I will briefly summarize wh
 at I did in reverse chronological order.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Nickolas Rollick\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, 
 University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Categorizing schemes in the wild" \n\nAb
 stract:  Last time\, we laid the groundwork necessary to make sense of the
  category of schemes.  This week\, we get a feel for this category via som
 e examples and structural facts.  In particular\, we will learn what the f
 inal object is\, construct non-trivial morphisms from a one-point scheme t
 o itself\, and look at the seemingly odd notion of scheme-valued points of
  a scheme.  It's truly a wild world these schemes live in...  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Brandon Doherty\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, U
 niversity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Goodstein sequences and the Hydra game" \
 n\nAbstract:  G\\"odel's incompleteness theorem proves the existence of ce
 rtain statements about the natural numbers that can be neither proven nor 
 disproven using basic first-order arithmetic. The kinds of statements cons
 tructed in the standard proof of the incompleteness theorem\, however\, ar
 e extremely technical\, and not very interesting in and of themselves. \n 
 This raises the question: are there any natural\, interesting statements a
 bout the natural numbers that are neither provable or disprovable in first
 -order arithmetic? In 1982\, Kirby and Paris provided examples of easily u
 nderstandable theorems which are true\, and can be stated in the language 
 of first-order arithmetic\, but cannot be proven. One of these states that
  every one of a class of sequences known as Goodstein sequences\, which in
 itially grow extremely quickly\, eventually decays to zero and terminates.
  The other states that a graph-theoretic game involving rooted trees\, kno
 wn as the Hydra game\, eventually terminates regardless of the player's st
 rategy.  \n \n   \n
