 rsity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Roth's Theorem" \n\nAbstract:  Roth's Theorem
  states that any subset of the integers with\npositive density will contai
 n three numbers in an arithmetic progression.\nWe will give a proof of Rot
 h's Theorem using Fourier analysis. Then\, we\nwill discuss an analogous r
 esult in the context of polynomial rings over\nfinite fields that can be p
 roved using the same technique.  \n \n  \n

SUMMARY:2-Semilattices: Residual Properties and Applications to Constraint

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Ian Payne\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, Univers
 ity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "2-Semilattices: Residual Properties and Applica
 tions to Constraint Satisfaction Problems" \n\nAbstract:  Semilattices are
  algebras known to have an important connection to partially ordered sets.
  In particular\, if a partially ordered set $(A\,\\leq)$ has greatest lowe
 r bounds\, a semilattice $(A\;\\wedge)$ can be associated to the order whe
 re $a\\wedge b$ is the greatest lower bound of $a$ and $b$. In this thesis
 \, we study a class of algebras known as $2$-semilattices\, which is a gen
 eralization of the class of semilattices. Similar to the correspondence be
 tween partial orders and semilattices\, there is a correspondence between 
 certain digraphs and $2$-semilattices. That is\, to every $2$-semilattice\
 , there is an associated digraph which holds information about the $2$-sem
 ilattice. Making frequent use of this correspondence\, we explore the clas
 s of $2$-semilattices from three perspectives: (i) Tame Congruence Theory\
 , (ii) the "residual character" of the class of $2$-semilattices\, and (ii
 i)\, the constraint satisfaction problem.\n Tame Congruence Theory\, devel
 oped by Hobby and McKenzie\, is a structure theory on finite algebras driv
 en by understanding prime congruence quotients of finite algebras. The the
 ory assigns to each such quotient a type from {\\bf 1} to {\\bf 5}. We sho
 w that types {\\bf 3}\, {\\bf 4}\, and {\\bf 5} can occur in the class of 
 $2$-semilattices\, but type {\\bf 4} can not occur in a finite simple $2$-
 semilattice.\n Classes of algebras contain "irreducible" members which hol
 d information about the class. Specifically\, the size of the irreducible 
 members has been of interest to many authors. We show for certain subclass
 es of the class of $2$-semilattices that there is no cardinal bound on the
  size of the irreducible members in that subclass.\n The "fixed template c
 onstraint satisfaction problem" can be identified with the decision proble
 m hom$(\\mathbb{A})$ where $\\mathbb{A}$ is a fixed finite relational stru
 cture. The input to hom$(\\mathbb{A})$ is a finite structure $\\mathbb{B}$
  similar to $\\mathbb{A}$. The question asked is "does there exist a homom
 orphism from $\\mathbb{B}$ to $\\mathbb{A}$?" Feder and Vardi conjectured 
 that for fixed $\\mathbb{A}$\, this decision problem is either {\\bf NP}-c
 omplete or solvable in polynomial time. Bulatov confirmed this conjecture 
 in the case that $\\mathbb{A}$ is invariant under a $2$-semilattice operat
 ion. We extend this result.  \n \n
