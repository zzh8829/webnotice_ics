DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Yuanhang Zhang\, Jilin University\nTitle:   "Connect
 ing invertible analytic Toeplitz operators in $G(\\mathcal{T}(\\mathcal{P}
 ^{\\perp}))$" \n\nAbstract:  We prove that there exists an orthonormal bas
 is $\\mathcal{F}$ for classical Hardy space $H^2$\, such that each inverti
 ble analytic Toeplitz operator $T_\\phi$ (i.e. $\\phi$ is invertible in $H
 ^\\infty$) could be connected to the identity operator via a norm continuo
 us path of invertible elements of the lower triangular operators with resp
 ect to $\\mathcal{F}$.\n This is a joint work with Ji\, Youqing (Jilin Uni
 versity) and Liu\, Li (Jilin University).  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Michael Deveau\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, Un
 iversity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Generalizing $\\omega^k$-c.e. for Relativi
 zation" \n\nAbstract:  Just as the arithmetic hierarchy characterizes redu
 ctions below various Turing jumps of $\\emptyset$\, Anderson and Csima sho
 wed that the Ershov hierarchy -- related to the notion of $\\omega^k$-c.e.
  -- characterizes reductions of bounded Turing jumps of $\\emptyset$. We d
 iscuss how to relativize this to reductions below bounded Turing jumps of 
 an arbitrary set.  \n \n \n

SUMMARY:Is any knot not the unknot? -  (Seminar)

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Patrick Naylor\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, Un
 iversity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Is any knot not the unknot?" \n\nAbstract:
   Ever wanted to learn something about knots? This is your chance! We'll t
 alk about some basics of knot theory\, including how to  prove some intuit
 ively `obvious' but mathematically tricky results.  Along the way\, we'll 
 see knot coloring invariants\, polynomial invariants\, and more. We'll eve
 n show how to produce a knotted surface: a  sphere ($S^2$) in $\\mathbb{R}
 ^4$ that is `knotted'. This talk will be very accessible and will include 
 many cool pictures.  \n \n    \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Tobias Fritz\, Perimeter Institute for Theoretical P
 hysics\nTitle:   "Special Colloquium: Real algebra\, random walks\, and in
 formation theory" \n\nAbstract:  Similar to how commutative algebra studie
 s rings and their ideals\, the protagonists of real algebra are ordered ri
 ngs. Their interplay between algebra and geometry is studied in terms of P
 ositivstellens√§tze\, real analogs of the Nullstellensatz\, which go back 
 to Artin's solution of Hilbert's 17th problem. I will describe some of the
  state of the art in this field\, and then introduce a new Positivstellens
 atz which unifies and generalizes several of the existing ones. While trad
 itional applications focus on polynomial rings\, I will sketch a broad ran
 ge of new applications in the second half\, comprising random walks\, asym
 ptotic representation theory\, and information theory.\nThe first applicat
 ion generalizes aspects of large deviation theory to a theory of asymptoti
 c comparison of two random walks.  \n \n
