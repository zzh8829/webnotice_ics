DESCRIPTION:The Hales-Jewett Theorem\nShouzhen Gu\, Department of Pure Mat
 hematics\, University of Waterloo\n\nWe give a proof of Schur's Theorem\, 
 which states that if the\nintegers from 1 to $N$ are coloured using $r$ co
 lours\, then for\nsufficiently large $N$\, there will be a monochromatic s
 olution to $x+y=z$.\nThen\, we present the Hales-Jewett Theorem on the exi
 stence of\nmonochromatic combinatorial lines in the integer points of a hy
 percube of\nhigh enough dimension. As a corollary\, we can find monochroma
 tic\narithmetic progressions of any given length in the integers from 1 to
  $N$\nfor large enough $N$\, which demonstrates van der Waerden's Theorem.

DESCRIPTION:Faizrahmanov-Kalimullin Theorem\nMohammad Mahmoud\, Department
  of Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\n\nThis week we finish the p
 roof of Faizrahmanov-Kalimullin Theorem which says that there is a structu
 re whose degree spectra is all the non-computable degrees\, but unlike the
  Slaman-Wehner structure\, there is no uniform computable way that gives u
 s a copy of the structure from any non-computable set.

DESCRIPTION:A gentle overview of some quantum algebras\, quantum groups\, 
 and their prime and primitive ideals\nBrendan Nolan\, University of Kent\n
 \nI will introduce some examples of quantum algebras and quantum groups\, 
 outlining some behaviour which they share with their classical counterpart
 s. I will discuss the Goodearl--Letzter stratification of quantum algebras
  with respect to the actions of algebraic tori\, which gives deep insights
  into the prime and primitive spectra of various quantum algebras.

DESCRIPTION:Brun's Sieve\nErtan Elma\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, Un
 iversity of Waterloo\n\nFirst\, we will have a look at Brun's Main Theorem
  (section  \n6.2 of the book An Introduction to Sieve Methods and Their  \
 nApplications\, by R. Murty\, C. Cojojaru) and then prove that there are  
 \ninfinitely many natural numbers n such that n and n+2 have at most 7  \n
 prime factors.

DESCRIPTION:Affine-local properties\nDiana Castaneda Santos\, Department o
 f Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\n\nWe will continue working on
  Section 5.3  of Ravi Vail's  \nnotes. Last time we discussed about the af
 fine communication lemma.  \nNow\, we will use it to define properties on 
 schemes that can be  \nverified locally on its affine pieces. Properties s
 uch as being  \nNoetherian\, being reduced or being of finite type over a 
 ring $A$\, can  \nbe verified in this way. Finally we will define affine a
 nd projective  \nvarieties over a field $k$ and show examples of these.
