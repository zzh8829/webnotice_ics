DESCRIPTION:Computable Functors and Effective Interpretability\nMichae
 l Deveau\,\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\nComp
 utability Learning Seminar\n\n\nWe introduce the notion of a computable fu
 nctor and the definition of effective inter- pretability. The former is a 
 computable analogue of a category-theoretic functor between ω-presentatio
 ns of structures\, and the latter is an effective version of model-theoret
 ic inter- pretability. We show that effective interpretations induce compu
 table functors\, and briefly mention the converse.

 tephen Wen\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\nStud
 ent Number Theory Seminars Seminar\n\n\nWe provide a proof of the Prime Nu
 mber Theorem over function fields. We examine and extend techniques used i
 n a zeta function proof of the theorem to other applications such as count
 ing square- and higher power- free polynomials of a given degree. If time 
 permits\, Dirichlet Series will be in- troduced with an aim towards provin
 g the analogue of Dirichlets Theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions.

 n\n\nWe will begin our construction of resolutions of the sheaf kernel of 
 a linear partial differential operator between vector bundles. Furthermore
 \, we will discuss some of the connections and interpretations of these re
 solutions in terms of deformation theory\, and outline how they can be app
 lied to the integrability problem for G-structures.

 -Hanson spaces\, Part III: Fibrewise blow-up by a family of Eguchi-Hanson 
 spaces\nSpiro Karigiannis\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, University 
 of Waterloo\nGeometry Working Seminar\n\n\nWe move on to the second of fou
 r main steps of the construction: resolving the orbifold singularities by 
 performing a fibre-wise blow up. The important point is that there is no n
 atural torsion-free G2 structure on this third glueing region. The natural
  G2 structure is not even closed. There is a natural way to correct it to 
 be closed\, which we will discuss. The third step is correcting this furth
 er to remove the leading error term in the torsion\, which is the third ma
 in step.
