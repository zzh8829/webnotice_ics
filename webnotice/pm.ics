DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Ehsaan Hossain\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, Un
 iversity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Problems on sofic and hyperlinear groups" 
 \n\nAbstract:  A sofic group is one that can be locally approximated by fi
 nite groups\; it is equivalent to embed into a "metric ultraproduct'' of f
 inite groups. A hyperlinear group is the same thing except with unitary ma
 trix groups instead of finite ones. So every sofic group is hyperlinear\, 
 but it is still standing whether these classes are the same. In fact nobod
 y knows even one example of a group that is not sofic or hyperlinear!\n So
 fic/hyperlinear groups are amongst the largest classes of groups for which
  various famous problems have been verified: Connes's embedding problem\, 
 Gottschalk surjunctivity\, and Kaplansky's group rings problems\, amongst 
 others --- so the problems in soficity can give solutions for even some of
  the biggest conjectures in other subjects. I'll learn about these and let
  you know what I find\, and as the semester progresses\, let's try to get 
 our hands dirty with these groups and see what the field is like.  \n \n

 tract:  To better understand the category of schemes I will explore finite
 ness properties that the morphisms between schemes may possess. In particu
 lar\, affine\, integral\, and other finite type conditions will be examine

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Peng-Jie Wong\, University of Lethbridge\nTitle:   "
 Holomorphy of L-functions and its applications" \n\nAbstract:  The analyti
 c properties of L-functions have been one of the \ncentral topics in numbe
 r theory as they have a deep connection \nwith the distribution of primes.
  For example\, the Riemann zeta \nfunction led to a proof of the celebrate
 d prime number theorem. In \ngeneral\, for any number field\, there are pr
 imes and L-functions of \nsimilar nature. In this talk\, we shall discuss 
 the holomorphy of \nsuch L-functions and its applications to the distribut
 ions of the \nassociated primes.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Justin Laverdure\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, 
 University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "The Hyperreals (Infinitesimals and the t
 ransfer principle)" \n\nAbstract:  Intuitive discussions about calculus am
 ong those 'uninitiated' into proper analysis often involve discussions abo
 ut "infinitely small" quantities. Foundations of calculus\, of course\, fr
 ame these as limiting processes\, but can an actual concept of an infinite
 simal number be recovered and worked with directly? Turns out the answer i
 s "yes": we may enlarge the real line in such a way that there are infinit
 esimal quantities\, those strictly greater than zero but less than every 1
 /n. \n In fact\, the real numbers and the hyperreal numbers are closely re
 lated: facts about one can be translated to facts about the other. Thus\, 
 understanding the real line helps us to understand the hyperreal line\, an
 d interestingly\, the converse as well. In particular\, certain proofs in 
 analysis admit simpler proofs\, once the techniques of "non-standard analy
 sis" have been introduced.  \n \n  \n

 idered as a special case.  \n \n \n

SUMMARY:Complexity and Capacity Bounds for Operator Systems and Quantum Ch

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Vern Paulsen\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, Univ
 ersity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Complexity and Capacity Bounds for Operator 
 Systems and Quantum Channels" \n\nAbstract:  This is based on joint work w
 ith R. Levine and I. Todorov.   \n  Shannon introduced the concept of the 
 one-shot zero-error capacity of a classical channel and proved that each s
 uch channel had a graph affiliated with it so that the one-shot zero-error
  capacity was the independence number of the graph.  The zero-error capaci
 ty is then obtained by taking the k-th root of the strong product of the g
 raph with itself k times and taking the supremum over k.  Shannon admitted
 ly couldnt compute this value for many graphs\, but then Lovasz introduc
 ed his theta function of a graph as a computable upper bound. The Lovasz t
 heta bound is still the best known bound for this capacity.\n Dean\, Sever
 ini\, and Winter studied Shannons ideas for quantum channels and proved 
 that each quantum channel has affiliated with it an operator system such t
 hat the one-shot zero-error capacity of the channel is the "independence n
 umber of the operator system. They then argued that the analogue of Shan
 nons capacity is to take the k-th root of the independence number of the
  tensor product of the operator system with itself k times and take the su
 premum over k.  They then introduced the analogue of the Lovasz theta func
 tion for an operator system.\n In this talk we will review these ideas and
  then introduce our new idea of the "complexity" of an operator system and
  show that this gives another bound on the zero-error capacity of the quan
 tum channel.  We will present several different linear algebraic character
 izations of complexity. We will then show that there are some operator sys
 tems and quantum channels for which our complexity based bound is better t
 han the Lovasz bound.  \n \n \n

SUMMARY:Real Fibered Morphism and Definite Determinantal Representations -

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Eli Shamovich\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, Uni
 versity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Real Fibered Morphism and Definite Determin
 antal Representations" \n\nAbstract:  Stable and hyperbolic polynomials ar
 ose in the study of differential equations. These polynomials give rise to
  real projective hypersurfaces with interesting convexity properties. Thes
 e convexity properties are used both in pure and applied mathematics (Kadi
 son-Singer and optimization for example). A good way to certify hyperbolic
 ity is to produce a definite determinant representation. Unfortunately\, t
 his is not always possible. In this talk I will present a generalization o
 f the hyperbolic property to morphisms between real projective varieties. 
 I will also discuss the notion of determinant representation and definite 
 Ulrich sheaves and show how the two notions relate. Time permitting\, I wi
 ll describe an algorithm to construct definite Ulrich sheaves on hyperboli
 c curves using theta functions with certain special characteristics on the
  normalization.\n This talk is based on joint works with V. Vinnikov and M
 . Kummer.  \n \n
