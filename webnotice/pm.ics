DESCRIPTION:Artin's conjecture on primitive roots and function field analo
 gues\nDavid Tweedle\, The University of the West Indies\n\nRecall Artin's 
 primitive root conjecture\, which states that if\n\\(a\\) is not \\(-1\\) 
 or a square then the reduction of \\(a\\) modulo \\(p\\)\ngenerates the mu
 ltiplicative group of the integers modulo \\(p\\) for\ninfinitely many pri
 mes \\(p\\).  We will examine the similarities and\ndifferences between Ar
 tin's conjecture and some natural analogues for\nelliptic curves and funct
 ion fields.

DESCRIPTION:Small sets in dense pairs\nPantelis Eleftheriou\, University o
 f Konstanz\n\nLet (M\, P) be an expansion of an o-minimal structure M by a
 \ndense subset P of M\, such that three tameness conditions hold. We prove
 \nthat the induced structure on P by M eliminates imaginaries. As a\ncorol
 lary\, we obtain that every small set X definable in M can be\ndefinably e
 mbedded into some P^n\, uniformly in parameters. We then verify\nthe tamen
 ess conditions in three examples: dense pairs\, expansions of M by\na dens
 e independent set\, and expansions by a dense divisible\nmultiplicative gr
 oup with the Mann property.

  of Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\n\nMany of us have heard tha
 t there is some sort of relationship between Ricci flow and renormalizatio
 n group flow in QFT. The goal of this talk/discussion will be to try and u
 nderstand this relationship.

DESCRIPTION:Effective Bi-interpretability -- Part 2\nMichael Deveau\, Depa
 rtment of Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\n\nWe continue explori
 ng the properties of effective bi-interpretability introduced last time. W
 e shall see that two structures being effectively bi-interpetable requires
  that they have very similar properties in terms of many of the notions di
 scussed thus far.

 gs\nBlake Madill\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo
 \n\nWe consider several radical classes of noncommutative rings. In partic

 aded rings\, monomial algebras\, and Ore extensions of derivation type.

DESCRIPTION:Scheming with my associates\nNickolas Rollick\, Department of 
 Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\n\nBy now\, we have seen a bewil
 dering number of adjectives that might be attached to a scheme\, some of w
 hich are topological in nature\, some of which are algebraic in nature\, a
 nd some of which refer to all the structural properties of the scheme at o
 nce.  To get our bearings\, we will start by recalling all the important a
 djectives discussed so far and categorize them.  Then\, we move to the top
 ic of associated points\, first looking at them in the context of finitely
  generated modules over a Noetherian ring.  Time permitting\, we will disc
 uss associated points of locally Noetherian schemes as well and see how th
 ey can be used to define rational functions on such schemes.

DESCRIPTION:Grad Student Colloquium: Physics for Mathematicians\nAnthony M
 cCormick\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\n\nWhat
  is Newton really saying when he writes $F=ma$? We know the $a$ stands for
  acceleration but the acceleration of what? The $F$ is supposed to be the 
 total force acting on the system but what precisely is meant by "force"? W
 hat is a "mechanical system"? What does Newton mean by an "inertial refere
 nce frame"? What is space? Time? I'll attempt to answer these questions in
  a way satisfactory for mathematicians. Furthermore\, if time permits\, I'
 ll try to explain some of the ideas behind modern physics and how mathemat
 icians can extract mathematically relevant ideas from physics talks.
