DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Dan Wolczuk\, Faculty of Mathematics\, University of
  Waterloo\nTitle:   "The Curse of Knowledge in Learning" \n\nAbstract:  In
  educational psychology\, the curse of knowledge refers to the phenomenon 
 that individuals inherently assume that the people they are communicating 
 with have the same knowledge and thought processes as they do. \n In this 
 seminar\, we will discuss how the curse of knowledge can affect both instr
 uctors and students\, and we will look at some strategies that instructors
  can use to try to counteract this and improve student learning.  \n \n
