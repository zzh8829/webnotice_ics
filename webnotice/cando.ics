DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Angèle Hamel\, Wilfrid Laurier University\nTitle:  
  "Chromatic Symmetric Functions and H-Free Graphs" \n\nAbstract:  Chromati
 c symmetric functions are defined in terms of colourings of particular gra
 phs. Some key conjectures in this area concern whether chromatic symmetric
  functions of claw-free graphs can be written in terms of other symmetric 
 functions with positive coefficients.  Here we extend the claw-free idea t
 o consider the e-positivity question for chromatic symmetric functions of 
 H-free graphs with H ={claw\, F}\,  where  F is a four-vertex graph.  We s
 ettle the question for all cases except H={claw\, co-diamond}\, and we pro
 vide some partial results in that case. This is joint work with Chinh Hoan
 g and Jake Tuero.  \n \n
