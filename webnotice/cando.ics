DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Alessandra Graf\, University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "
 Hypergraphs\, Entropy\, and Inequalities" \n\nAbstract:  In this talk\, we
  discuss a generalization of Shearer's entropy lemma for weighted hypergra
 phs due to Friedgut (2004). We then show that by applying this generalizat
 ion to certain hypergraphs\, one can recover some well known inequalities\
 , such as the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and Hölder's inequality.  \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Erin Meger\, Ryerson University\nTitle:   "The Itera
 ted Local Model for Social Networks" \n\nAbstract:  On-line social network
 s such as Facebook and Twitter are often studied through friendships betwe
 en users. Adversarial relationships also play an important role in the str
 ucture of these social networks. We define the Iterated Local Model (ILM) 
 utilizing the transitive and anti-transitive generative mechanisms within 
 social networks. These mechanisms provide a precise analogy to the adages 
 "the enemy of my enemy is my friend\," and "friends of friends are friends
 ." \n Complex networks exhibit four key properties: large scale\, evolutio
 n over time\, power law degree distribution\, and the small world property
 . Densification is also observed in complex networks\, where the average d
 egree of the network increases over time. Each of these properties will be
  discussed for the ILM. Structural properties of the graphs generated by I
 LM\, including the hamiltonicity and the chromatic number\, will also be e
 xplored.  \n \n    \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Patrick Naylor\, University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "I
 s any knot not the unknot?" \n\nAbstract:  THIS SEMINAR HAS BEEN RE-SCHEDU
 LED FROM THE PREVIOUS WEEK\n Ever wanted to learn something about knots? T
 his is your chance! We'll talk about some basics of knot theory\, includin
 g how to prove some intuitively `obvious' but mathematically tricky result
 s. Along the way\, we'll see knot coloring invariants\, polynomial invaria
 nts\, and more. We'll even show how to produce a knotted surface: a sphere
  ($S^2$) in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ that is `knotted'. This talk will be very acce
 ssible and will include many cool pictures.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Courtney Paquette\, University of Waterloo\nTitle:  
  "High-dimensional probability: Random vectors in high dimensions" \n\nAbs
 tract:  In this talk\, I will finish our discussion of concentration inequ
 alities\, particularly\, I will discuss the sub-exponential distribution a
 nd state Bernsteins inequality\; thereby completing our study of large d
 eviations. Following this\, I will introduce random vectors which live in 
 high-dimensions. Life in high dimensions presents new challenges which ste
 ms from the fact that there is exponentially more room in high dimensions 
 than in lower dimensions. The abundance of room in higher dimensions makes
  algorithmic tasks exponentially more difficult. Probability in high dimen
 sions will give us some tools to circumvent these difficulties. I will sta
 rt by examining the Euclidean norm of a random vector X with independent c
 oordinates\, and show that the norm concentrates tightly about its mean. T
 hen I will state and prove some basic results (e.g. isotropic distribution
 s) and give examples of high-dimensional distributions (e.g. multi-variant
  normal\, spherical\, etc). Finally\, I will examine principle component a
 nalysis (PCA)\, a tool which is of utmost importance in probability\, stat
 istics\, data science\, and optimization.  \n \n  \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Stephen J. Wright\, Computer Sciences Department and
  Wisconsin Institute for Discovery\, University of Wisconsin-Madison\nTitl
 e:   "Optimization in Data Analysis: Some Recent Developments" \n\nAbstrac
 t:  Optimization is vital to the modern revolution in data science\, and t
 echniques from optimization have become essential in formulating and solvi
 ng a wide variety of data analysis problems. In turn\, data science has ca
 used a ferment of new research activity in optimization by posing challeng
 ing new problems and new contexts. We start this talk with an overview of 
 the many problem classes in data science in which optimization provides th
 e key solution methodology. We then focus on several areas of growing rece
 nt interest\, including the interplay between optimization and data analys
 is in such areas as\nnonconvex optimization\, robust optimization\, advers
 arial machine learning\, neural networks\, and matrix optimization.  \n \n

SUMMARY:Toward a Theory of Crossing-Critical Graphs -  (Tutte Colloquium S

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Bojan Mohar\, Simon Fraser University\nTitle:   "Tow
 ard a Theory of Crossing-Critical Graphs" \n\nAbstract:  The crossing numb
 er of a graph is defined as the minimum number of crossings of edges in a 
 drawing of the graph in the plane. In his seminal 1970 paper Toward a Theo
 ry of Crossing Numbers\, Tutte made a fundamental contribution by proving 
 what is known today as the Hanani-Tutte Theorem. Since then\, the theory o
 f crossing numbers of graphs made a long way. The talk will outline a rece
 nt completion of a long-term project to give a structural description of c
 rossing-critical graphs. These are graphs in which the removal of any edge
  decreases the crossing number.\n This is joint work with Zdenek Dvorak an
 d Petr Hlineny.  \n \n  \n

SUMMARY:IETF encryption standards post-TLS 1.3 -  (Special Seminar)

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Nick Sullivan\, Cloudflare\nTitle:   "IETF encryptio
 n standards post-TLS 1.3" \n\nAbstract:  TLS is one of the most important 
 security protocols online. Its most famously used in web browsing\, prov
 iding the S in HTTPS. After five years of discussions\, debates\, deployme
 nts\, compromises\, and ultimately industry consensus\, in the Internet En
 gineering Task Force (IETF) standardized a new version of the protocol\, T
 LS 1.3\, published as RFC 8446 in late 2018. The improvements TLS 1.3 brin
 gs over previous versions are substantial\, but it left several questions 
 unanswered.\n With TLS 1.3 complete\, the IETFs TLS working group has po
 inted its attention to new work. In this talk\, Ill explore how IETF sta
 ndards are created\, how to participate in the process\, what new standard
 s are currently under discussion\, and how they relate to the future of se
 curity online. Ill be exploring new proposals including Encrypted SNI\, 
 Delegated Credentials\, Exported Authenticators\, OPAQUE\, and semi-static
  DH\, and exploring some open research angles.\n About the speaker: \nNick
  Sullivan is Head of Cryptography at Cloudflare\, where he is responsible 
 for overseeing all cryptographic aspects of Cloudflare's products. He is p
 assionate about improving security and privacy online through cutting-edge
  research and the development of open standards. Prior to joining Cloudfla
 re\, he helped build and secure Apples multi-billion dollar iTunes store
 . He has a Master of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics from the 
 University of Calgary and a BMath from the University of Waterloo in Pure 
 Math and C&O.  \n \n
