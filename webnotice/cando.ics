DESCRIPTION:Line Search in Polymatroids\nDr. Michel Goemans\, Massachusett
 s Institute of Technology\n\nWe consider the classical problem of finding 
 the intersection of a line and an (extended) polymatroid in dimension n. W
 hen the direction of the line is nonnegative\, the problem is well-underst
 ood and the Discrete Newton method will require at most n trials. For gene
 ral directions\, however\, no bound (depending only on the dimension) was 
 known and we provide a quadratic upper bound. The analysis relies on sever
 al extremal results\, such as the length of the longest chain of ring fami
 lies (closed under intersection and union) or the length of the longest ge
 ometrically increasing sequence of values for a submodular function.

DESCRIPTION:Counting spanning subgraphs subject to degree constraints\nDr.
  David Wagner\, University of Waterloo\n\nThe Heilmann-Lieb Theorem on mat
 ching polynomials gives detailed information about the location of zeros o
 f the polynomial $\\sum_k m_k(G) x^k$\, in which $m_k(G)$ is the number of
  $k$-edge matchings of a graph $G$.  It has a stronger multivariate versio
 n. I will describe a general method which produces theorems of this type\,
  with the set of matchings of $G$ replaced by the set of $(f\,g)$-factors 
 of $G$:\\ for any two functions $f\,g:V(G)\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N}$\, an \\
 emph{$(f\,g)$-factor} $H$ is a spanning subgraph such that $f(v) \\leq \\d
 eg(H\,v) \\leq g(v)$ for all $v\\in V(G)$.  (The Heilmann-Lieb Theorem is 
 the case $f\\equiv 0$ and $g\\equiv 1$.)

DESCRIPTION:Some connectivity results for 2-polymatroids\nJames Oxley\, Lo
 uisiana State University\n\nFor a graph $G$ and each subset  $X$ of $E(G)$
 \, let $r(X)$ be the number of vertices incident with some edge in $X$.  F
 rom the pair $(E(G)\,r)$\, which is an example of a $2$-polymatroid\, one 
 can detemine $G$ up to isolated vertices and one can recognize matchings i
 n $G$. The cycle matroid in $G$ does not allow the determination of either
  of these things. Loosely speaking\, a $2$-polymatroid is like a matroid e
 xcept that individual elements can have rank $2$ instead of just $0$ or $1
 $. In joint work with Charles Semple and Geoff Whittle\, the speaker has b
 een seeking connectivity results for $2$-polymatroids that resemble corres
 ponding results for matroids.

SUMMARY:The Mathematical Contributions of W.T. Tutte (Colloquium)

DESCRIPTION:The Mathematical Contributions of W.T. Tutte\nDr. James Oxley\
 , Louisiana State University\n\n"If a theorem about graphs can be expresse
 d in terms of edges and circuits only it probably exemplifies a more gener
 al theorem about matroids". Bill Tutte wrote these words in a commentary o
 n his 1966 paper 'Connectivity in matroids'. Indeed\, he went on to write 
 that a "belief in this general principle" led him to seek a matroid genera
 lization of his 1961 theorem that distinguishes the special role that whee
 ls play among 3-connected graphs. Because of the impossibility of doing ju
 stice to all of Bill's mathematical contributions in a single colloquium\,
  this talk will concentrate on those contributions that lie on the interfa
 ce between graph theory and matroid theory.
