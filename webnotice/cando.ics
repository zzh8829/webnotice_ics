DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Krystal Guo\, University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Poly
 nomials of graphs" \n\nAbstract:  The characteristic polynomials and match
 ing polynomials of a graph are well-known graph polynomials. We study a mo
 re general graph polynomial\, which attains both of the polynomials in spe
 cial contexts\, using a construction from graph embeddings. The underlying
  theory uses Viennot's theory of heaps.  \n \n  \n

 encoding a Diophantine equation into a matroid and state a conjecture whic
 h\, if true\, would give a novel way of solving Diophantine equations over
  the reals.  \n \n  \n

SUMMARY:Graph Routing Problems: Approximation\, Hardness\, and Graph-Theor

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Dr. Julia Chuzhoy\, Toyota Technological Institute a
 t Chicago\nTitle:   "Graph Routing Problems: Approximation\, Hardness\, an
 d Graph-Theoretic Insights" \n\nAbstract:  In a typical routing problem\, 
 we are given a graph G\, and a collection(s_1\,t_1)\,..\,(s_k\,t_k) of pai
 rs of its vertices\, called demand pairs\, that we would like to route. In
  order to route a demand pair (s_i\,t_i)\, we need to choose a path connec
 ting s_i to t_i in G. Our goal is usually to route as many of the demand p
 airs as possible\, while keeping the congestion of the routing - the maxim
 um load on any vertex or an edge of G - as small as possible. This general
  framework gives rise to a number of basic and widely studied graph routin
 g problems\, that have lead to the development of a rich toolkit of algori
 thmic techniques\, as well as structural graph theoretic results. In this 
 talk we will describe some of the recent developments in approximation alg
 orithms for graph routing problems\, and highlight some connections betwee
 n this area and graph theory.  \n \n  \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Nick Rollick\, Pure Mathematics\, University of Wate
 rloo\nTitle:   "Dots\, lines\, and arrows" \n\nAbstract:  In this talk\, w
 e will survey connected-homomorphism-homogeneous graphs\, which is a fancy
  way of talking about manipulations with dots\, lines\, and arrows.  (In t
 he grown-up language of mathematicians\, that means vertices\, edges\, and
  graph homomorphisms.)  After familiarizing ourselves with the language of
  connected-homomorphism-homogeneous graphs\, we will examine a gallery of 
 graphs illustrating some classification results\, started by Deborah Locke
 tt\, and which I subsequently expanded on.  For my friends in PMATH\, this
  should serve as a gentle and entertaining introduction to the terminology
  of graph theory.  For my friends in CO\, this is a really easy area to ge
 t into\, containing some accessible open problems.  \n \n \n

SUMMARY:Tight lower bounds for the complexity of multicoloring -  (Colloqu

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Marthe Boname\, University of Bordeaux\nTitle:   "Ti
 ght lower bounds for the complexity of multicoloring" \n\nAbstract:  In th
 e multicoloring problem\, also known as $(a:b)$ or $b$-fold coloring\, we 
 are given a graph $G$ and a set of a colors\, and the task is to assign a 
 subset of $b$ colors to each vertex of $G$ so that adjacent vertices recei
 ve disjoint color subsets. This natural generalization of the classic colo
 ring problem (the $b=1$ case) is equivalent to finding a homomorphism to t
 he Kneser graph with parameters a and b. It is tightly connected with the 
 fractional chromatic number\, and has multiple applications within compute
 r science.\nWe study the complexity of determining whether a graph has an 
 $(a:b)$-coloring. Nederlof showed in 2008 a $(b+1)^n*n^O(1)$-time algorith
 m for $(a:b)$-coloring. Our main result is that this is essentially optima
 l: there is no algorithm with running time $2^o(log b)⋅n$ unless the Exp
 onential Time Hypothesis fails. The crucial ingredient in our hardness red
 uction is the usage of detecting matrices of Lindstr| om (1965)\, which 
 is a combinatorial tool that\, to the best of our knowledge\, has not yet 
 been used for proving complexity lower bounds. This talk is also meant as 
 an introduction to the ETH.\n This is joint work with  {\\L}ukasz Kowalik\
 , Micha{\\l}  Pilipczuk\, Arkadiusz Soca{\\l}a and Marcin Wrochna (Univers
 ity of Warsaw).  \n \n  \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Dr. Richard Stanley\, MIT\nTitle:   "Smith Normal Fo
 rm and Combinatorics" \n\nAbstract:  Let $R$ be a commutative ring (with i
 dentity) and $A$ an $n\\times n$ matrix over $R$. Suppose there exist $n\\
 times n$ matrices $P\,Q$ invertible over $R$ for which $PAQ$ is a diagonal
  matrix diag$(e_1\,\\dots\,e_r\,0\,\\dots\,0)$\, where $e_i$ divides $e_{i
 +1}$ in $R$. We then call $PAQ$ a \\emph{Smith normal form}(SNF) of $A$. I
 f $R$ is a PID then an SNF always exists and is unique up to multiplicatio
 n by units. Moreover if $A$ is invertible then $\\det A=u\\alpha_1\\cdots 
 \\alpha n$\, where $u$ is a unit\, so SNF gives a canonical factorization 
 of $\\det A$.\n We will survey some connections between SNF and combinator
 ics. Topics will include (1) the general theory of SNF\, (2) a close conne
 ction between SNF and chip firing in graphs\, (3) the SNF of a random matr
 ix of integers (joint work with Yinghui Wang)\, (4) SNF of special classes
  of matrices\, including some arising in the theory of symmetric functions
 \, hyperplane arrangements\, and lattice paths.  \n \n
