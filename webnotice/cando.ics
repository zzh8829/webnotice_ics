DESCRIPTION:Line Search in Polymatroids\nDr. Michel Goemans\, Massachusett
 s Institute of Technology\nWe consider the classical problem of finding th
 e intersection of a line and an (extended) polymatroid in dimension n. Whe
 n the direction of the line is nonnegative\, the problem is well-understoo
 d and the Discrete Newton method will require at most n trials. For genera
 l directions\, however\, no bound (depending only on the dimension) was kn
 own and we provide a quadratic upper bound. The analysis relies on several
  extremal results\, such as the length of the longest chain of ring famili
 es (closed under intersection and union) or the length of the longest geom
 etrically increasing sequence of values for a submodular function.

DESCRIPTION:Counting spanning subgraphs subject to degree constraints\nDr.
  David Wagner\, University of Waterloo\nThe Heilmann-Lieb Theorem on match
 ing polynomials gives detailed information about the location of zeros of 
 the polynomial $\\sum_k m_k(G) x^k$\, in which $m_k(G)$ is the number of $
 k$-edge matchings of a graph $G$.  It has a stronger multivariate version.
  I will describe a general method which produces theorems of this type\, w
 ith the set of matchings of $G$ replaced by the set of $(f\,g)$-factors of
  $G$:\\ for any two functions $f\,g:V(G)\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N}$\, an \\em
 ph{$(f\,g)$-factor} $H$ is a spanning subgraph such that $f(v) \\leq \\deg
 (H\,v) \\leq g(v)$ for all $v\\in V(G)$.  (The Heilmann-Lieb Theorem is th
 e case $f\\equiv 0$ and $g\\equiv 1$.)

DESCRIPTION:Some connectivity results for 2-polymatroids\nJames Oxley\, Lo
 uisiana State University\nFor a graph $G$ and each subset  $X$ of $E(G)$\,
  let $r(X)$ be the number of vertices incident with some edge in $X$.  Fro
 m the pair $(E(G)\,r)$\, which is an example of a $2$-polymatroid\, one ca
 n detemine $G$ up to isolated vertices and one can recognize matchings in 
 $G$. The cycle matroid in $G$ does not allow the determination of either o
 f these things. Loosely speaking\, a $2$-polymatroid is like a matroid exc
 ept that individual elements can have rank $2$ instead of just $0$ or $1$.
  In joint work with Charles Semple and Geoff Whittle\, the speaker has bee
 n seeking connectivity results for $2$-polymatroids that resemble correspo
 nding results for matroids.

SUMMARY:The Mathematical Contributions of W.T. Tutte (Colloquium)

DESCRIPTION:The Mathematical Contributions of W.T. Tutte\nDr. James Oxley\
 , Louisiana State University\n"If a theorem about graphs can be expressed 
 in terms of edges and circuits only it probably exemplifies a more general
  theorem about matroids". Bill Tutte wrote these words in a commentary on 
 his 1966 paper 'Connectivity in matroids'. Indeed\, he went on to write th
 at a "belief in this general principle" led him to seek a matroid generali
 zation of his 1961 theorem that distinguishes the special role that wheels
  play among 3-connected graphs. Because of the impossibility of doing just
 ice to all of Bill's mathematical contributions in a single colloquium\, t
 his talk will concentrate on those contributions that lie on the interface
  between graph theory and matroid theory.
