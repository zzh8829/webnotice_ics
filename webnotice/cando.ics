DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Krystal Guo\, University of WaterlooTitle: "Polynomia
 ls of graphs"\nAbstract: The characteristic polynomials and matching polyn
 omials of a graph are well-known graph polynomials. We study a more genera
 l graph polynomial\, which attains both of the polynomials in special cont
 exts\, using a construction from graph embeddings. The underlying theory u
 ses Viennot's theory of heaps. \n\n  \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Jim Geelen\, University of WaterlooTitle: "Matroids d
 oing algebra"\nAbstract: We describe a folklore construction for encoding 
 a Diophantine equation into a matroid and state a conjecture which\, if tr
 ue\, would give a novel way of solving Diophantine equations over the real

SUMMARY:Graph Routing Problems: Approximation\, Hardness\, and Graph-Theor

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Dr. Julia Chuzhoy\, Toyota Technological Institute at
  ChicagoTitle: "Graph Routing Problems: Approximation\, Hardness\, and Gra
 ph-Theoretic Insights"\nAbstract: In a typical routing problem\, we are gi
 ven a graph G\, and a collection(s_1\,t_1)\,..\,(s_k\,t_k) of pairs of its
  vertices\, called demand pairs\, that we would like to route. In order to
  route a demand pair (s_i\,t_i)\, we need to choose a path connecting s_i 
 to t_i in G. Our goal is usually to route as many of the demand pairs as p
 ossible\, while keeping the congestion of the routing - the maximum load o
 n any vertex or an edge of G - as small as possible. This general framewor
 k gives rise to a number of basic and widely studied graph routing problem
 s\, that have lead to the development of a rich toolkit of algorithmic tec
 hniques\, as well as structural graph theoretic results. In this talk we w
 ill describe some of the recent developments in approximation algorithms f
 or graph routing problems\, and highlight some connections between this ar
 ea and graph theory. \n\n  \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Nick Rollick\, Pure Mathematics\, University of Water
 looTitle: "Dots\, lines\, and arrows"\nAbstract: In this talk\, we will su
 rvey connected-homomorphism-homogeneous graphs\, which is a fancy way of t
 alking about manipulations with dots\, lines\, and arrows.  (In the grown-
 up language of mathematicians\, that means vertices\, edges\, and graph ho
 momorphisms.)  After familiarizing ourselves with the language of connecte
 d-homomorphism-homogeneous graphs\, we will examine a gallery of graphs il
 lustrating some classification results\, started by Deborah Lockett\, and 
 which I subsequently expanded on.  For my friends in PMATH\, this should s
 erve as a gentle and entertaining introduction to the terminology of graph
  theory.  For my friends in CO\, this is a really easy area to get into\, 
 containing some accessible open problems. \n\n \n

SUMMARY:Tight lower bounds for the complexity of multicoloring -  (Colloqu

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Marthe Boname\, University of BordeauxTitle: "Tight l
 ower bounds for the complexity of multicoloring"\nAbstract: In the multico
 loring problem\, also known as $(a:b)$ or $b$-fold coloring\, we are given
  a graph $G$ and a set of a colors\, and the task is to assign a subset of
  $b$ colors to each vertex of $G$ so that adjacent vertices receive disjoi
 nt color subsets. This natural generalization of the classic coloring prob
 lem (the $b=1$ case) is equivalent to finding a homomorphism to the Kneser
  graph with parameters a and b. It is tightly connected with the fractiona
 l chromatic number\, and has multiple applications within computer science
 .\nWe study the complexity of determining whether a graph has an $(a:b)$-c
 oloring. Nederlof showed in 2008 a $(b+1)^n*n^O(1)$-time algorithm for $(a
 :b)$-coloring. Our main result is that this is essentially optimal: there 
 is no algorithm with running time $2^o(log b)⋅n$ unless the Exponential 
 Time Hypothesis fails. The crucial ingredient in our hardness reduction is
  the usage of detecting matrices of Lindstr| om (1965)\, which is a comb
 inatorial tool that\, to the best of our knowledge\, has not yet been used
  for proving complexity lower bounds. This talk is also meant as an introd
 uction to the ETH.\nThis is joint work with  {\\L}ukasz Kowalik\, Micha{\\
 l}  Pilipczuk\, Arkadiusz Soca{\\l}a and Marcin Wrochna (University of War
 saw). \n\n  \n

SUMMARY:Smith Normal Form and Combinatorics -  (Colloquium)

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Dr. Richard Stanley\, MITTitle: "Smith Normal Form an
 d Combinatorics"\nAbstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring (with identity) 
 and $A$ an $n\\times n$ matrix over $R$. Suppose there exist $n\\times n$ 
 matrices $P\,Q$ invertible over $R$ for which $PAQ$ is a diagonal matrix d
 iag$(e_1\,\\dots\,e_r\,0\,\\dots\,0)$\, where $e_i$ divides $e_{i+1}$ in $
 R$. We then call $PAQ$ a \\emph{Smith normal form}(SNF) of $A$. If $R$ is 
 a PID then an SNF always exists and is unique up to multiplication by unit
 s. Moreover if $A$ is invertible then $\\det A=u\\alpha_1\\cdots \\alpha n
 $\, where $u$ is a unit\, so SNF gives a canonical factorization of $\\det
  A$.\nWe will survey some connections between SNF and combinatorics. Topic
 s will include (1) the general theory of SNF\, (2) a close connection betw
 een SNF and chip firing in graphs\, (3) the SNF of a random matrix of inte
 gers (joint work with Yinghui Wang)\, (4) SNF of special classes of matric
 es\, including some arising in the theory of symmetric functions\, hyperpl
 ane arrangements\, and lattice paths. \n\n
