DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Zdenek Dvorak\, Charles University\nTitle:   "Chroma
 tic number of triangle-free graphs" \n\nAbstract:  While there exist trian
 gle-free graphs of arbitrarily large chromatic number\, in some contexts i
 t is possible to obtain better bounds on the chromatic number when triangl
 es are forbidden.  For example\, graphs of maximum degree Delta can\nhave 
 chromatic number up to Delta+1\, but triangle-free graphs of maximum degre
 e Delta have chromatic number O(Delta/log Delta).  In contrast\, there exi
 st d-degenerate triangle-free graphs that are not d-colorable (but all d-d
 egenerate graphs are (d+1)-colorable)\, showing that in this context\nforb
 idding triangles does not help.\n In a joint work with Ken-ichi Kawarabaya
 shi\, we recently proved that triangle-free graphs of tree-width t are cei
 l((t+3)/2)-colorable\, and this bound is tight.  In addition to this resul
 t\, I will outline connections to (non)approximability of chromatic number
  in proper minor-closed classes\, and\npropose further related problems.

SUMMARY:Max-sum diversity via convex programming and local search -  (Tutt

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Friedrich Eisenbrand\, École Polytechnique Fédéra
 le de Lausanne EPFL\nTitle:   "Max-sum diversity via convex programming an
 d local search" \n\nAbstract:  Diversity maximization is an important conc
 ept in information retrieval\, computational geometry and operations resea
 rch. Usually\, it is a variant of the following problem: Given a ground se
 t\, constraints\, and a function f(⋅) that measures diversity of a subse
 t\, the task is to select a feasible subset S such that f(S) is maximized.
  The sum-dispersion function f(S) is the sum of the pairwise distances in 
 S\, is in this context a prominent diversification measure. The correspond
 ing diversity maximization is the max-sum or sum-sum diversification. Alre
 ady for one cardinality constraint\, max-sum diversification cannot be app
 roximated better than by a factor of 1/2 if the distances are metric.  We 
 present a PTAS for the max-sum diversification problem for distances d(⋅
 \,⋅) of negative type for various constraint settings\, including matroi
 d constraints and matroid intersection constraints. Distances of negative 
 type are\, for example\, metric distances stemming from the §¤2 and §¤
 1 norm\, as well as the cosine or spherical\, or Jaccard distance which ar
 e popular similarity metrics in web and image search. \n Joint work with A

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Dr. Maria Chudnovsky\, Princeton University\nTitle: 
   "Coloring graphs with forbidden induced subgraphs" \n\nAbstract:  The pr
 oblem of testing if a graph can be colored with a given number k of colors
  in NP-complete for every k > 2. But what if we have more information abou
 t the input graph\, namely that some xed graph H is not present in it as 
 an induced subgraph? It is known that the problem remains NP-complete even
  for k = 3\, unless H is the disjoint union of paths. We consider the foll
 owing two questions:\n 1) For which graphs H is there a polynomial time al
 gorithm to 3-color (or in general k-color) an H-free graph?\n 2) For which
  graphs H are there nitely many 4-critical H-free graphs?\n This talk wil
 l survey recent progress on these questions\, an in particular give a comp
 lete answer to the second one.  \n \n      \n

 rsity\nTitle:   "The Man Who Knew Infinity: the Movie\, the Man\, and the
  Mathematics" \n\nAbstract:  In the spring of 2016\, the motion picture\, 
 The Man Who Knew Innity\, was released. It is now available on DVD. The m
 ovie tells the life story of the Indian genius\, Ramanujan. In this talk\,
  I hope to start with the trailer from the movie. Then I shall provide som
 e discussion of Ramanujan's life. I plan to provide a glimpse of his mathe
 matics contained in the celebrated Lost Notebook. I hope to conclude with 
 some discussion of how computer algebra illuminates our study of the many 
 challenges left by Ramanujan.  \n \n
