DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Dr. Maria Chudnovsky\, Princeton University\nTitle: 
   "Coloring graphs with forbidden induced subgraphs" \n\nAbstract:  The pr
 oblem of testing if a graph can be colored with a given number k of colors
  in NP-complete for every k > 2. But what if we have more information abou
 t the input graph\, namely that some xed graph H is not present in it as 
 an induced subgraph? It is known that the problem remains NP-complete even
  for k = 3\, unless H is the disjoint union of paths. We consider the foll
 owing two questions:\n 1) For which graphs H is there a polynomial time al
 gorithm to 3-color (or in general k-color) an H-free graph?\n 2) For which
  graphs H are there nitely many 4-critical H-free graphs?\n This talk wil
 l survey recent progress on these questions\, an in particular give a comp
 lete answer to the second one.  \n \n              \n

SUMMARY:The Man Who Knew Infinity: the Movie\, the Man\, and the Mathemat

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Dr. George E. Andrews\, The Pennsylvania State Unive
 rsity\nTitle:   "The Man Who Knew Infinity: the Movie\, the Man\, and the
  Mathematics" \n\nAbstract:  In the spring of 2016\, the motion picture\, 
 The Man Who Knew Innity\, was released. It is now available on DVD. The m
 ovie tells the life story of the Indian genius\, Ramanujan. In this talk\,
  I hope to start with the trailer from the movie. Then I shall provide som
 e discussion of Ramanujan's life. I plan to provide a glimpse of his mathe
 matics contained in the celebrated Lost Notebook. I hope to conclude with 
 some discussion of how computer algebra illuminates our study of the many 
 challenges left by Ramanujan.  \n \n
