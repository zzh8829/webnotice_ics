DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  David Gosset\, IBM - T.J. Watson Research Center\nTi
 tle:   "Algorithms and complexity for quantum advantage" \n\nAbstract:  Th
 ere is strong evidence that a sufficiently large fault-tolerant quantum co
 mputer would solve certain computational problems exponentially faster tha
 n any classical computer. How can quantum algorithms and complexity theory
  help guide the way forward in our current era of small and noisy quantum 
 computers?\n A quantum computer without error correction will likely be li
 mited to implementing short depth quantum circuits.  In the first part of 
 the talk I will describe a linear algebra problem which is solved by a con
 stant-depth quantum circuit but provably cannot be solved by any classical
  circuit of less than logarithmic depth. This constitutes an unconditional
  separation between constant depth quantum circuits and their classical co
 unterparts.\n Classical simulation algorithms can be used to verify small 
 quantum computers and to help demarcate the classically easy and hard regi
 mes. In the second part of the talk I will describe a classical algorithm 
 that can be used to simulate quantum circuits over the Clifford+T gate set
  with mildly exponential scaling in the number of T gates.\n Finally\, I w
 ill discuss how quantum computer science is intimately linked with our und
 erstanding of physical systems and the complexity of simulating them. I wi
 ll describe how a universal quantum computer is equivalent in computationa
 l power to a quantum many-body system consisting of indistinguishable part
 icles which move and interact on the vertices of a graph.  \n \n  \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Luis Ruiz\, University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "ALBANI
 S: A brief overview of Lattice-Based NIST Submissions" \n\nAbstract:  Now 
 that the NIST competition is in the first round of the review process\, it
  is our turn to take a look at the submissions (at least\, briefly). In th
 is session we will talk about the ones in the lattice-based category.  \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Cathy Wang\, University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Const
 ructing Graphs Pseudo-Similar Vertices" \n\nAbstract:  Let G be a graph. L
 et a and b be vertices in G\, then a and b are pseudo-similar if G\\a is i
 somorphic to G\\b\, but there's no automorphism of G that maps a onto b. I
 n this talk\, we introduce some constructions of graphs with pseudo-simila
 r vertices by Godsil and Kocay in 1980s.  \n \n
