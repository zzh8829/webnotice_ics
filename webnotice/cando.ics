DESCRIPTION:Polynomials of graphs\nKrystal Guo\, University of Waterloo\n\
 nThe characteristic polynomials and matching polynomials of a graph are we
 ll-known graph polynomials. We study a more general graph polynomial\, whi
 ch attains both of the polynomials in special contexts\, using a construct
 ion from graph embeddings. The underlying theory uses Viennot's theory of 
 heaps.

DESCRIPTION:Matroids doing algebra\nJim Geelen\, University of Waterloo\n\
 nWe describe a folklore construction for encoding a Diophantine equation i
 nto a matroid and state a conjecture which\, if true\, would give a novel 
 way of solving Diophantine equations over the reals.

DESCRIPTION:Graph Routing Problems: Approximation\, Hardness\, and Graph-T
 heoretic Insights\nDr. Julia Chuzhoy\, Toyota Technological Institute at C
 hicago\n\nIn a typical routing problem\, we are given a graph G\, and a co
 llection(s_1\,t_1)\,..\,(s_k\,t_k) of pairs of its vertices\, called deman
 d pairs\, that we would like to route. In order to route a demand pair (s_
 i\,t_i)\, we need to choose a path connecting s_i to t_i in G. Our goal is
  usually to route as many of the demand pairs as possible\, while keeping 
 the congestion of the routing - the maximum load on any vertex or an edge 
 of G - as small as possible. This general framework gives rise to a number
  of basic and widely studied graph routing problems\, that have lead to th
 e development of a rich toolkit of algorithmic techniques\, as well as str
 uctural graph theoretic results. In this talk we will describe some of the
  recent developments in approximation algorithms for graph routing problem
 s\, and highlight some connections between this area and graph theory.
