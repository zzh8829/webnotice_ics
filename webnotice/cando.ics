DESCRIPTION:Infinitly many excluded minors for frame matroids and for lift
 ed-graphic matroids\nRong Chen\, Center for Discrete Mathematics\n\nIn thi
 s talk\, I will present infinite sequences of excluded minors for both the
  class of lifted-graphic matroids and the class of frame matroids. This is
  joint work with Jim Geelen.

DESCRIPTION:Semigroup spectral methods and graph coloring games\nDr. Fan C
 hung Graham\, University of California\n\nWe consider a coloring game on g
 raphs as an example to illustrate the effectiveness of the semigroup spect
 ral method for determining the spectrum of the directed graphs which arise
  as the state graphs associated with the game. Originating from the study 
 of the so-called Tsetlin library random walks and the like\, this  method 
 can be used to  analyze dynamic processes such as  voting and ranking\, pr
 ovided the random processes satisfy certain "memoryless" conditions (corre
 sponding to left-regular-band semigroups).
