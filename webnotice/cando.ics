DESCRIPTION:Polynomials of graphs\nKrystal Guo\, University of Waterloo\nc
 ando\nSeminar\n\n\nThe characteristic polynomials and matching polynomials
  of a graph are well-known graph polynomials. We study a more general grap
 h polynomial\, which attains both of the polynomials in special contexts\,
  using a construction from graph embeddings. The underlying theory uses Vi
 ennot's theory of heaps.

 ould give a novel way of solving Diophantine equations over the reals.

DESCRIPTION:Graph Routing Problems: Approximation\, Hardness\, and Graph-T
 heoretic Insights\nDr. Julia Chuzhoy\, Toyota Technological Institute at C
 hicago\ncando\nSeminar\n\n\nIn a typical routing problem\, we are given a 
 graph G\, and a collection(s_1\,t_1)\,..\,(s_k\,t_k) of pairs of its verti
 ces\, called demand pairs\, that we would like to route. In order to route
  a demand pair (s_i\,t_i)\, we need to choose a path connecting s_i to t_i
  in G. Our goal is usually to route as many of the demand pairs as possibl
 e\, while keeping the congestion of the routing - the maximum load on any 
 vertex or an edge of G - as small as possible. This general framework give
 s rise to a number of basic and widely studied graph routing problems\, th
 at have lead to the development of a rich toolkit of algorithmic technique
 s\, as well as structural graph theoretic results. In this talk we will de
 scribe some of the recent developments in approximation algorithms for gra
 ph routing problems\, and highlight some connections between this area and
  graph theory.

 niversity of Waterloo\ncando\nColloquium\n\n\nIn this talk\, we will surve
 y connected-homomorphism-homogeneous graphs\, which is a fancy way of talk
 ing about manipulations with dots\, lines\, and arrows.  (In the grown-up 
 language of mathematicians\, that means vertices\, edges\, and graph homom
 orphisms.)  After familiarizing ourselves with the language of connected-h
 omomorphism-homogeneous graphs\, we will examine a gallery of graphs illus
 trating some classification results\, started by Deborah Lockett\, and whi
 ch I subsequently expanded on.  For my friends in PMATH\, this should serv
 e as a gentle and entertaining introduction to the terminology of graph th
 eory.  For my friends in CO\, this is a really easy area to get into\, con
 taining some accessible open problems.

SUMMARY:Tight lower bounds for the complexity of multicoloring - cando (Co

DESCRIPTION:Tight lower bounds for the complexity of multicoloring\nMarthe
  Boname\, University of Bordeaux\ncando\nColloquium\n\n\nIn the multicolor
 ing problem\, also known as $(a:b)$ or $b$-fold coloring\, we are given a 
 graph $G$ and a set of a colors\, and the task is to assign a subset of $b
 $ colors to each vertex of $G$ so that adjacent vertices receive disjoint 
 color subsets. This natural generalization of the classic coloring problem
  (the $b=1$ case) is equivalent to finding a homomorphism to the Kneser gr
 aph with parameters a and b. It is tightly connected with the fractional c
 hromatic number\, and has multiple applications within computer science.\n
 We study the complexity of determining whether a graph has an $(a:b)$-colo
 ring. Nederlof showed in 2008 a $(b+1)^n*n^O(1)$-time algorithm for $(a:b)
 $-coloring. Our main result is that this is essentially optimal: there is 
 no algorithm with running time $2^o(log b)⋅n$ unless the Exponential Tim
 e Hypothesis fails. The crucial ingredient in our hardness reduction is th
 e usage of detecting matrices of Lindstr| om (1965)\, which is a combina
 torial tool that\, to the best of our knowledge\, has not yet been used fo
 r proving complexity lower bounds. This talk is also meant as an introduct
 ion to the ETH.

SUMMARY:Smith Normal Form and Combinatorics - cando (Colloquium)

DESCRIPTION:Smith Normal Form and Combinatorics\nDr. Richard Stanley\, MIT
 \ncando\nColloquium\n\n\nLet $R$ be a commutative ring (with identity) and
  $A$ an $n\\times n$ matrix over $R$. Suppose there exist $n\\times n$ mat
 rices $P\,Q$ invertible over $R$ for which $PAQ$ is a diagonal matrix diag
 $(e_1\,\\dots\,e_r\,0\,\\dots\,0)$\, where $e_i$ divides $e_{i+1}$ in $R$.
  We then call $PAQ$ a \\emph{Smith normal form}(SNF) of $A$. If $R$ is a P
 ID then an SNF always exists and is unique up to multiplication by units. 
 Moreover if $A$ is invertible then $\\det A=u\\alpha_1\\cdots \\alpha n$\,
  where $u$ is a unit\, so SNF gives a canonical factorization of $\\det A$
