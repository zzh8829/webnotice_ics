DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Walaa Moursi\, Stanford University\nTitle:   "The Do
 uglas-Rachford splitting algorithm for inconsistent minimization problems"
  \n\nAbstract:  The Douglas--Rachford (DR) method is one of the most \npop
 ular splitting methods in optimization.\nThe method was first introduced i
 n 1956 to numerically solve certain types of heat equations. \nIn their se
 minal work Lions (a Fields' medalist) and Mercier extended the algorithm t
 o find a zero \nof the sum of two\, not necessarily linear and possibly se
 t-valued\, maximally monotone operators in possibly infinite-dimensional H
 ilbert spaces.\nNowadays\, the method is a very popular splitting techniqu
 e for finding a minimizer of the sum of two convex functions\, more genera
 lly a zero of the sum of two maximally monotone operators.\nNonetheless\, 
 the behaviour of the algorithm remains mysterious in the general inconsist
 ent case\, i.e.\, when the sum problem has no zeros\, which corresponds to
  the absence of minimizers. However\, more than a decade ago\, it was show
 n that in the (possibly inconsistent) convex feasibility setting\, the so-
 called shadow sequence remains bounded and its weak cluster points solve a
  best approximation problem. In this talk\, we advance the understanding o
 f the inconsistent case significantly by presenting a complete proof of th
 e full weak convergence in the convex feasibility setting. We also provide
  strong and linear rates of convergence in special cases.  \n \n        \n

SUMMARY:Robust counterpart approximations of scalar chance constraints -

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Reading Group\, University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Ro
 bust counterpart approximations of scalar chance constraints" \n\nAbstract
 :  We will cover section 2.1\, section 2.2 and part of section 2.3 of the 
 book Robust Optimization by Ben-Tal et al. Given a non-deterministic linea
 r inequality and its uncertainty set\, there is a chance that coefficients
  of the non-deterministic linear inequality can be determined outside of t
 he uncertainty set with a very small probability. We will introduce basic 
 notions of chance constraints\, its difficulties as well as its strengths.

 le:   "On Pretty Good State Transfer\, Entanglement\, and Spin Chains" \n\
 nAbstract:  We discuss the Vieira and Rigolin paper Almost perfect trans
 port of an entangled two-qubit state through a spin chain\, which consid
 ers slight modifications to a spin chain (I.e. path) that allows a maximal
 ly entangled two-qubit state to be almost perfectly transferred from one e
 nd to the other.  \n \n   \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Diego Cifuentes\, MIT\nTitle:   "Polynomial systems:
  Graphical structure\, Geometry\, and Applications" \n\nAbstract:  Various
  problems in areas such as robotics\, power systems\, computer vision\, cr
 yptography\, and chemical reaction networks\, can be modeled by systems of
  polynomial equations\, and in many cases the resulting systems have a sim
 ple sparsity structure. In the  first part of this talk we represent this 
 sparsity structure with a graph\, and study the algorithmic and complexity
  consequences of this graphical abstraction. In particular\, we derive nov
 el algorithms to solve polynomial systems. These methods outperform existi
 ng techniques by orders of magnitude in certain applications from algebrai
 c statistics and vector addition systems.\n The second part of this talk f
 ocuses on the problem of minimizing a polynomial function subject to polyn
 omial equality constraints. This problem captures many important applicati
 ons\, including Max-Cut\, tensor low rank approximation\, the triangulatio
 n problem\, and rotation synchronization. Although these problems are nonc
 onvex\, tractable semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations have been pro
 posed. We show novel guarantees on the quality of this relaxations. In par
 ticular\, we prove that estimation problems such as camera triangulation\,
  rank one tensor approximation and rotation synchronization can be solved 
 exactly by SDP relaxations in the low noise regime.  \n \n
