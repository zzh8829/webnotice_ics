DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Richard Lang\, University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Int
 roduction to Entropy and Counting" \n\nAbstract:  In the first talk of our
  reading group\, we introduce the notion of entropy and derive some of its
  basic properties. When then go through a few examples that illustrate how
  entropy can be used to count combinatorial objects.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  TBD\, University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Reading grou
 p on the topic of "Entropy and Counting"" \n\nAbstract:  A new Reading Gro
 up will be starting this term\, on the topic of "Entropy and Counting".\n 
 The first talk will take place on Tuesday\, Jan 22\, 2019 from 2:00 p.m. t
 o 3:00 p.m. in MC 6486\, and will continue on a weekly basis at the same t
 ime and location.\n We will study how the notion entropy can be used as a 
 tool for combinatorial enumeration. In the first couple of talks\, the bas
 ic properties of entropy are covered and its use is illustrated with a few
  examples. We then continue by reading a selection of classic and recent p
 apers.\n Organizers: Michelle Delcourt and Richard Lang  \n \n     \n

SUMMARY:Induced Poset Saturation -  (Seminar)

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Bill Kay\, Ryerson University\nTitle:   "Induced Pos
 et Saturation" \n\nAbstract:  In Graph Theory\, we say that a graph $G$ is
  $H$ saturated if $G$ contains no copy of $H$ as a subgraph\, but on addit
 ion of any edge $G$ contains a copy of $H$. For example\, any bipartite gr
 aph is triangle saturated. The {\\em saturation number} of a graph $H$ (de
 noted sat$(n\,H)$) is the minimum number of edges in an $H$ saturated grap
 h on $n$ vertices.  Saturation serves as a complementary question to extre
 mal numbers and has been well studied in the case of graphs. Note that for
  any combinatorial object with a subobject relation we have a notion of sa
 turation. In this talk\, we introduce (induced) saturation in the realm of
  Partially Ordered Sets (Posets).  Joint work with  Michael Ferrara\,  Luc
 as Kramer\, Ryan R. Martin\, Benjamin Reiniger\, Heather C. Smith\, Eric S
 ullivan  \n \n   \n

SUMMARY:Edge State Transfer -  (Algebraic Graph Theory Seminar)

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Tina Chen\, University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Edge S
 tate Transfer" \n\nAbstract:  So far the most studied quantum walks are th
 e ones whose Hamiltonians are the adjacency matrices of the underlying gra
 phs and initial states are vertex states $e_a$. This talk focuses on Lapla
 cian edge state transfer\, that is\, the quantum walks whose initial state
 s are edge states $e_a-e_b$and Hamiltonians are the Laplacians of the unde
 rlying graphs. \n We will extend some known results of vertex state transf
 er to Laplacian edge state transfer and introduce some basic properties of
  Laplacian edge state transfer. We will prove two useful closure propertie
 s for perfect Laplacian edge state transfer. One is that complementation p
 reserves perfect edge state transfer.  The other is that if $G$ has vertex
  state transfer and $H$ has edge state transfer\, then with some mild assu
 mption on the pairs of vertex states and edge states that have perfect sta
 te transfer\, the Cartesian product $G\\square H$also admits perfect edge 
 state transfer. We will talk about one interesting transitivity phenomenon
  that happens in Laplacian edge state transfer which never happens in vert
 ex state transfer.\n We will give characterizations of perfect Laplacian e
 dge state transfer in cycles\, paths. We will also briefly mention the cas
 e when the unsigned Laplacian is Hamiltonian and initial states are plus s
 tates of the form $e_a+e_b$.  \n \n      \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Justin Toth\, University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Addi
 tive Approximation of Chromatic Number in Apex-minor-free Graphs" \n\nAbst
 ract:  In this talk we will see a t+3 additive approximation to the chroma
 tic number for t-apex-minor-free graphs. This talk is based on the paper "
 Additive non-approximability of chromatic number in proper minor-closed cl
 asses" by Dvorak and Kawarabayashi.  \n \n
