 raphic matroids -  (Seminar)

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Rong Chen\, Center for Discrete Mathematics\, Fuzhou
  University\nTitle:   "Infinitly many excluded minors for frame matroids a
 nd for lifted-graphic matroids" \n\nAbstract:  In this talk\, I will prese
 nt infinite sequences of excluded minors for both the class of lifted-grap
 hic matroids and the class of frame matroids. This is joint work with Jim 
 Geelen.  \n \n    \n

SUMMARY:Semigroup spectral methods and graph coloring games -  (Colloquium

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Dr. Fan Chung Graham\, University of California\nTit
 le:   "Semigroup spectral methods and graph coloring games" \n\nAbstract: 
  We consider a coloring game on graphs as an example to illustrate the eff
 ectiveness of the semigroup spectral method for determining the spectrum o
 f the directed graphs which arise as the state graphs associated with the 
 game. Originating from the study of the so-called Tsetlin library random w
 alks and the like\, this  method can be used to  analyze dynamic processes
  such as  voting and ranking\, provided the random processes satisfy certa
 in "memoryless" conditions (corresponding to left-regular-band semigroups)
 .  \n \n \n
