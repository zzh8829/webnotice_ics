DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Dr. Martin Lysy\, Department of  Statistics and Act
 uarial Science\, University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Stochastic Modeling of 
 Observables in Nanoscopic Systems " \n\nAbstract:  The advent of nano-ins
 trumentation has led to a surge of "single particle tracking" experiments\
 , wherein the dynamics of one or more observables of a biophysical system 
 are recorded at extremely high accuracy and resolution.  Central to the m
 odeling of such experiments is the Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE)\, a
  stochastic model for interacting particle systems encoding the fundamenta
 l laws of physical motion.\n Alas\, the GLE is a stochastic integro-differ
 ential equation all but invariably lacking a closed-form solution.  I wil
 l discuss two ongoing efforts to render the GLE more tractable: (i) the ex
 plicit representation of any continuous stationary-increments Gaussian pro
 cess as a linear GLE\, and (ii) the approximate simulation of nonlinear GL
 Es to arbitrary accuracy.  These results are motivated by recent analyses
  of subdiffusive pathogen dynamics in pulmonary mucus\, and of the curious
  behavior of water molecules in the vicinity of a protein.  \n \n
