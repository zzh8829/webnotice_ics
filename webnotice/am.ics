DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Justin Shaw\, Department of Applied Mathematics\, Un
 iversity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "A Simple Example of Dimension Reduction" \
 n\nAbstract:  We are overwhelmed with information\, but raw data by itself
  is generally not helpful.  We need a way to make sense of information by 
 determining which part of it is the most important for a given application
 .  There are numerous mathematical methods which can be used to extract fe
 atures from a dataset.  In this talk we will use wavelet and empirical ort
 hogonal function (EOF) methods to examine in situ measurements from Honeoy
 e Lake in upstate New York.   These two methods identify features on diffe
 rent timescales.  We will then show how EOFs can be used to represent the 
 original data by a simple reduced order model.  This model\, while having 
 half the dimension of the original data\, retains enough information to ac
 curately construct the time series for the Wedderburn number and the Schmi
 dt Stability Index with a small RMS error.   The more general problem\, al
 ong with possible directions for future work\, will then be discussed.  \n

SUMMARY:A modelling investigation into the impacts of the convective param

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Shawn Corvec\, Department of Applied Mathematics\, U
 niversity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "A modelling investigation into the impact
 s of the convective parameterization on the tropical circulation" \n\nAbst
 ract:  Many studies have shown that the tropical circulations (Walker and 
 Hadley circulations) will weaken in a warmer world. This is sometimes attr
 ibuted to changes in the tropical mean water cycling rate (driven by conve
 ctive mass flux)\, which does not increase as fast as boundary layer water
  vapour in the tropics. However\, this theory is only valid for the large 
 scale upward convective mass flux in the tropics\, not necessarily to the 
 local circulations\, which are not as energetically constrained. Here\, we
  show that there is also a potential regime in which this argument does no
 t hold by simply changing the convective scheme in a climate model. This r
 egime is one in which the tropical mean convective mass flux can actually 
 increase with warming\, provided the precipitation efficiency decreases si
 gnificantly. Our work supports the theory that the uniform tropical mean s
 tatic stability increase is the physical driver of the weakening of the tr
 opical circulations with climate change\, which is mainly driven by the tr
 opical mean SST increase\, regardless of the change in strength of convect
 ive mass flux. The local changes in tropospheric diabatic heating from hea
 ting are shown to influence the magnitude of the weakening of the Walker c
 irculation.\n We find that the precipitation efficiency decreases in an in
 creased sea surface temperature AMIP-type experiment using the CAM4 AGCM w
 ith an alternate convective scheme using a unique mass flux closure\, lead
 ing to a plausible scenario where tropical mean convective mass flux may i
 ncrease\, while the large-scale tropical circulations still weaken. While 
 large-scale upward motion and convective mass flux are closely correlated 
 spatially\, the nature of this relationship can change in a warmer world i
 f the precipitation efficiency changes. A decrease in precipitation effici
 ency can allow for increased upward convective mass flux\, but the same tr
 opospheric heating rate response\, as the increased rate of condensational
  heating is offset by increased evaporational cooling. A decrease in preci
 pitation efficiency leads to a lower heating rate per unit of upward mass 
 flux due to a compensating increase in evaporation. The large tropical mea
 n evaporation response seen with this scheme allows for stronger tropical 
 mean convective updrafts\, especially of the shallow variety\, to balance 
 where the evaporational cooling response is maximized.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Mikhai Panine\, Department of Applied Mathematics\, 
 University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "On Perturbative Methods in Spectral Geom
 etry" \n\nAbstract:  The goal of spectral geometry is to establish how muc
 h information about the geometry of compact Riemannian manifolds is contai
 ned in the spectra of natural differential operators\, especially Laplacia
 ns\, defined on them. Ideally\, one would like to be able to recover the R
 iemannian manifold\, up to isometry\, from the spectra of one or several s
 uch operators. This would be a very powerful result\, as it would introduc
 e an invariant way to describe the shape of Riemannian manifolds. The cons
 equences of such a result would range from practical applications to shape
  recognition to theoretical insights into quantum gravity.\n However\, the
  most general form of such statements is known to be false. There is a num
 ber of known counterexamples\, that is isospectral but not isometric manif
 olds. Indeed\, there are even techniques to construct such counterexamples
 . Nonetheless\, it is believed that almost all Riemannian manifolds can be
  identified by their spectra. In other words\, the counterexamples are exp
 ected to be exceedingly rare special cases. This has been shown to be the 
 case in some restricted classes of manifolds. The proof in the general cas
 e has remained elusive.\n The main goal of this thesis is to move towards 
 such a proof by studying the structure of isospectral sets of metrics. The
  main tool we use for this purpose is perturbation theory\, a method ubiqu
 itous in physics\, but strangely underused in spectral geometry. Consequen
 tly\, a secondary goal of this work is to demonstrate the usefulness of pe
 rturbation theory to the study of spectral geometry. We begin by a numeric
 al exploration of spectral geometry in a perturbative regime. Then\, we sh
 ow that sets of isospectral conformally equivalent metrics on boundaryless
  manifolds of dimension two contain no convex subsets. This is an entirely
  new type of result in spectral geometry. We argue that it could lead to a
  proof of the rarity of counterexamples to the program of identifying shap
 es by their spectra.\n The thesis also includes reviews of the fundamental
 s of the spectral theory of Laplace-type operators\, of major results in s
 pectral geometry and of perturbation theory.  \n \n        \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Keegan Keplinger\, Department of Applied Mathematics
 \, University of     Waterloo\nTitle:   "Persistent Oscillations in the Ap
 lysia bag cell network" \n\nAbstract:  The Aplysia bag cell neuron serves 
 as an ideal model for dynamical switching in persistent neural systems. Pe
 rsistent neural systems can exhibit long-term responses to stimulus\, \nof
 ten switching from the traditional excitable\, steady-state dynamics to a 
 period of re- \npeated spiking or bursting. In Aplysia\, such behavior\, k
 nown as the afterdischarge\, is exhibited by the bag cell neuron and regul
 ated by second messenger calcium dynamics. \nA model is constructed based 
 on experimental data that includes many qualitative fea- \ntures of the Ap
 lysia bag cell electrophysiology\, including use-dependence\, non-selectiv
 e cation channels\, calcium persistence\, all of which contribute to after
 discharge dynamics. Several methods are used to fit experimental data and 
 construct the model\, including hand tuning\, parameter forcing\, genetic 
 algorithms\, and continuation analysis in an effort to overcome degeneracy
 \, sensitivity\, and other barriers to complex model construction. Once th
 e neuron model is established\, a diffusively-coupled network model is con
 structed to simulate the electrical coupling observed in bag cell clusters
  in nature. A simple two-neuron network reproduces some experimental resul
 ts and larger networks are considered. Little is known about the topology 
 of Aplysia bag cell neurons. The final chapter of this thesis explores dif
 ferent topologies in a 100-neuron network\, exploring how the coupling con
 stant\, topology\, and size of the network affects the networks ability 
 to synchronize.  \n \n  \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Kexue Zhang\, Department of Applied Mathematics\, Un
 iversity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Impulsive Control of Dynamical Networks" \
 n\nAbstract:  Dynamical networks (DNs) consist of a large set of interconn
 ected nodes with each node being a fundamental unit with detailed contents
 . A great number of natural and man-made networks such as social networks\
 , food networks\, neural networks\, the Work Wide Web\, elec-trical power 
 grid\, etc.\, can be effectively modeled by DNs. The main focus of the pre
 sent thesis is on delay-dependent impulsive control of DNs. To study the i
 mpulsive control problem of DNs\, we ﬁrstly construct stability results 
 for general nonlinear time-delay systems with de-layed impulses by using t
 he method of Lyapunov functionals and Razumikhin technique.\nSecondly\, we
  study the consensus problem of multi-agent systems with both ﬁxed and s
 witching topologies. A hybrid consensus protocol is proposed to take into 
 consideration of continuous-time communications among agents and delayed i
 nstant information exchanges on a sequence of discrete times. Then\, a nov
 el hybrid consensus protocol with dynamically changing interaction topolog
 ies is designed to take the time-delay into account in both the continuous
 -time communication among agents and the instant information exchange at d
 is-crete moments. We also study the consensus problem of networked multi-a
 gent systems. Dis-tributed delays are considered in both the agent dynamic
 s and the proposed impulsive consen-sus protocols.\nLastly\, stabilization
  and synchronization problems of DNs under pinning impulsive control are s
 tudied. A pinning algorithm is incorporated with the impulsive control met
 hod. We pro-pose a delay-dependent pinning impulsive controller to investi
 gate the synchronization of lin-ear delay-free DNs on time scales. Then\, 
 we apply the pinning impulsive controller proposed for the delay-free netw
 orks to stabilize time-delay DNs. Results show that the delay-dependent pi
 nning impulsive controller can successfully stabilize and synchronize DNs 
 with/without time-delay. Moreover\, we design a type of pinning impulsive 
 controllers that relies only on the network states at history moments (not
  on the states at each impulsive instant). Sufﬁ-cient conditions on stab
 ilization of time-delay networks are obtained\, and results show that the 
 proposed pinning impulsive controller can effectively stabilize the networ
 k even though only time-delay states are available to the pinning controll
 er at each impulsive instant. We fur-ther consider the pinning impulsive c
 ontrollers with both discrete and distributed time-delay effects to synchr
 onize the drive and response systems modeled by globally Lipshitz time-del
 ay systems. As an extension study of pinning impulsive control approach\, 
 we investigate the synchronization problem of systems and networks governe
 d by PDEs.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Zhen Wang\, Department of Applied Mathematics\, Univ
 ersity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Clustering Behavior in Networks with Time De
 layed\, Global\, Circulant Coupling" \n\nAbstract:  Networks of coupled os
 cillators arise in a variety of areas. Clustering is a type of oscillatory
  network behavior where elements of a network segregate into groups. Eleme
 nts within a group oscillate synchronously\, while elements in different g
 roups oscillate with a fixed phase difference. In this thesis\, we study n
 etworks of N identical oscillators with time delayed\, global circulant co
 upling with two approaches.\n We first use the theory of weakly coupled os
 cillators to reduce the system \nof delay differential equations to a phas
 e model where the time delay \nenters as a phase shift.  We use the phase 
 model to determine\nmodel independent existence and stability results for 
 symmetric \ncluster solutions. We show that the presence of the time delay
  can lead to the coexistence of multiple stable clustering solutions.\n We
  then perform stability and bifurcation analysis to the original system of
  delay differential equations with symmetry. We first study the existence 
 of Hopf bifurcations induced by coupling time delay\, and then use symmetr
 ic Hopf bifurcation theory to determine how these bifurcations lead to dif
 ferent patterns of symmetric cluster oscillations. We apply our results to
  two specific examples: a network of FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons with diffusiv
 e coupling and a network of Morris-Lecar neurons with synaptic coupling. I
 n the case studies\, we show how time delays in the coupling between neuro
 ns can give rise to switching between different stable cluster solutions\,
  coexistence of multiple stable cluster solutions and solutions with multi
 ple frequencies.  \n \n
