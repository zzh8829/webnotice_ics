DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Terry Lyons\, Oxford University\nTitle:   "From Hopf
  Algebras to Machine learning via Rough Paths" \n\nAbstract:  Rough path t
 heory aims to build an effective calculus that can model the interactions 
 between complex oscillatory (rough) evolving systems. At its mathematical 
 foundations\, it is a combination of analysis blended with algebra that go
 es back to LC Young\, and to KT Chen. Key to the theory is the essential n
 eed to incorporate additional non-commutative structure into areas of math
 ematics we thought were stable. At its high points\, there are the regular
 ity structures of Martin Hairer that allow robust meaning to be given to n
 umerous core nonlinear stochastic pdes describing evolving interfaces in p
 hysics.\n Classic results\, by Clark\, Cameron and Dickinson\, demonstrate
  that a nonlinear approach to the data is essential.  Rough path theory li
 ves up to this challenge and can be viewed as providing fundamentally more
  efficient ways of approximately describing complex data\; approaches that
 \, after penetrating the basic ideas\, are computationally tractable and l
 ead to new scalable ways to regress\, classify\, and learn functional rela
 tionships from data. One non-mathematical application that is already stri
 king is the use of signatures on a daily basis in the online recognition o
 f Chinese Handwriting on mobile phones.  \n \n
