DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Justin Shaw\, Department of Applied Mathematics\, Un
 iversity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "A Simple Example of Dimension Reduction" \
 n\nAbstract:  We are overwhelmed with information\, but raw data by itself
  is generally not helpful.  We need a way to make sense of information by 
 determining which part of it is the most important for a given application
 .  There are numerous mathematical methods which can be used to extract fe
 atures from a dataset.  In this talk we will use wavelet and empirical ort
 hogonal function (EOF) methods to examine in situ measurements from Honeoy
 e Lake in upstate New York.   These two methods identify features on diffe
 rent timescales.  We will then show how EOFs can be used to represent the 
 original data by a simple reduced order model.  This model\, while having 
 half the dimension of the original data\, retains enough information to ac
 curately construct the time series for the Wedderburn number and the Schmi
 dt Stability Index with a small RMS error.   The more general problem\, al
 ong with possible directions for future work\, will then be discussed.  \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Mikhai Panine\, Department of Applied Mathematics\, 
 University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "On Perturbative Methods in Spectral Geom
 etry" \n\nAbstract:  The goal of spectral geometry is to establish how muc
 h information about the geometry of compact Riemannian manifolds is contai
 ned in the spectra of natural differential operators\, especially Laplacia
 ns\, defined on them. Ideally\, one would like to be able to recover the R
 iemannian manifold\, up to isometry\, from the spectra of one or several s
 uch operators. This would be a very powerful result\, as it would introduc
 e an invariant way to describe the shape of Riemannian manifolds. The cons
 equences of such a result would range from practical applications to shape
  recognition to theoretical insights into quantum gravity.\n However\, the
  most general form of such statements is known to be false. There is a num
 ber of known counterexamples\, that is isospectral but not isometric manif
 olds. Indeed\, there are even techniques to construct such counterexamples
 . Nonetheless\, it is believed that almost all Riemannian manifolds can be
  identified by their spectra. In other words\, the counterexamples are exp
 ected to be exceedingly rare special cases. This has been shown to be the 
 case in some restricted classes of manifolds. The proof in the general cas
 e has remained elusive.\n The main goal of this thesis is to move towards 
 such a proof by studying the structure of isospectral sets of metrics. The
  main tool we use for this purpose is perturbation theory\, a method ubiqu
 itous in physics\, but strangely underused in spectral geometry. Consequen
 tly\, a secondary goal of this work is to demonstrate the usefulness of pe
 rturbation theory to the study of spectral geometry. We begin by a numeric
 al exploration of spectral geometry in a perturbative regime. Then\, we sh
 ow that sets of isospectral conformally equivalent metrics on boundaryless
  manifolds of dimension two contain no convex subsets. This is an entirely
  new type of result in spectral geometry. We argue that it could lead to a
  proof of the rarity of counterexamples to the program of identifying shap
 es by their spectra.\n The thesis also includes reviews of the fundamental
 s of the spectral theory of Laplace-type operators\, of major results in s
 pectral geometry and of perturbation theory.  \n \n
