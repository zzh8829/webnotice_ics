DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Terry Lyons\, Oxford UniversityTitle: "From Hopf Alge
 bras to Machine learning via Rough Paths"\nAbstract: Rough path theory aim
 s to build an effective calculus that can model the interactions between c
 omplex oscillatory (rough) evolving systems. At its mathematical foundatio
 ns\, it is a combination of analysis blended with algebra that goes back t
 o LC Young\, and to KT Chen. Key to the theory is the essential need to in
 corporate additional non-commutative structure into areas of mathematics w
 e thought were stable. At its high points\, there are the regularity struc
 tures of Martin Hairer that allow robust meaning to be given to numerous c
 ore nonlinear stochastic pdes describing evolving interfaces in physics.\n
 Classic results\, by Clark\, Cameron and Dickinson\, demonstrate that a no
 nlinear approach to the data is essential.  Rough path theory lives up to 
 this challenge and can be viewed as providing fundamentally more efficient
  ways of approximately describing complex data\; approaches that\, after p
 enetrating the basic ideas\, are computationally tractable and lead to new
  scalable ways to regress\, classify\, and learn functional relationships 
 from data. One non-mathematical application that is already striking is th
 e use of signatures on a daily basis in the online recognition of Chinese 
 Handwriting on mobile phones. \n\n
