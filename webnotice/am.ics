DESCRIPTION:Energy Losses and Radiation in Interaction of Relativistic Cha
 rged Particles with Layered Nano-structures\nKamran Akbari\, Department of
  Applied Mathematics\n\nThe study of the interaction of relativistic charg
 ed particles with matter at the nano-scale is important since it is at the
  core of many problems in Electromagnetic Theory\, Condensed Matter Physic
 s\, Nano-science and Technology\, Mathematical Physics\, Electrical Engine
 ering\, and Material Science. One of the most import configurations for su
 ch interactions arises in the context of electron-energy-loss spectroscopy
  (EELS) of nano-meter sized specimens within transmission electron microsc
 ope.

SUMMARY:On the Theory and Application of Early Warning Signals for Critica

DESCRIPTION:On the Theory and Application of Early Warning Signals for Cri
 tical Transitions\nTom Bury\, Department of Applied Mathematics\n\nAbrupt 
 and often irreversible transitions can be observed in a wide variety of sy
 stems including ecological communities\, complex disease and social networ
 ks. These so-called 'critical transitions' can be brought on by a gradual 
 change in external conditions that quietly reduce the resilience of a syst
 em. Despite their seemingly unpredictable nature\, generic early warning s
 ignals have been proposed which\, once verified for a particular system\, 
 could provide the means for mitigating or even preventing unwanted transit
 ions. However\, in higher dimensions\, the typical early warning signals c
 an become amplified\, muted\, or even reversed\, due to the intricate vari
 able interactions in the approach to the transition. In addition\, these m
 ore complex systems can exhibit a wider variety of transitions to their si
 mplified counterparts. This thesis aims to pin down the mechanisms that ca
 use these particular alterations in early warning signals\, which may then
  work in our favour by helping us characterise the transition being approa
 ched. Working alongside models in the social\, ecological and biological s
 ciences\, we hope to contribute the the challenging task of detecting near
 by critical transitions in these fields.

DESCRIPTION:From Hopf Algebras to Machine learning via Rough Paths\nTerry 
 Lyons\, Oxford University\n\nRough path theory aims to build an effective 
 calculus that can model the interactions between complex oscillatory (roug
 h) evolving systems. At its mathematical foundations\, it is a combination
  of analysis blended with algebra that goes back to LC Young\, and to KT C
 hen. Key to the theory is the essential need to incorporate additional non
 -commutative structure into areas of mathematics we thought were stable. A
 t its high points\, there are the regularity structures of Martin Hairer t
 hat allow robust meaning to be given to numerous core nonlinear stochastic
  pdes describing evolving interfaces in physics.
