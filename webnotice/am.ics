DESCRIPTION:From Hopf Algebras to Machine learning via Rough Paths\nTerry 
 Lyons\, Oxford University\n\nRough path theory aims to build an effective 
 calculus that can model the interactions between complex oscillatory (roug
 h) evolving systems. At its mathematical foundations\, it is a combination
  of analysis blended with algebra that goes back to LC Young\, and to KT C
 hen. Key to the theory is the essential need to incorporate additional non
 -commutative structure into areas of mathematics we thought were stable. A
 t its high points\, there are the regularity structures of Martin Hairer t
 hat allow robust meaning to be given to numerous core nonlinear stochastic
  pdes describing evolving interfaces in physics.
