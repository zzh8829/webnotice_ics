DESCRIPTION:Summer heat overwinters in the Arctic Ocean\nProfessor Mary-Lo
 uise Timmermans\, Yale University\nThe talk will address the implications 
 of a warming Arctic Ocean on the overlying sea-ice\ncover. In recent years
 \, atypically warm water layers have been observed at depth in the\nArctic
  Ocean. These derive from intense summertime solar heating in expansive ic
 e-free\nregions. Heat that is stored in the shallow ocean can be released 
 in the fall and winter by\nshear-driven mixing\, and convective mixing by 
 the release of dense plumes during sea-ice\ngrowth\, reducing the net sea-
 ice growth. On the other hand\, deeper warm ocean layers\nremain unaffecte
 d. I'll show that under continued warming\, there exists the possibility f
 or a\nregime shift in ocean ventilation by these warm waters\, and a subse
 quent cap on the storage\nof deep-ocean heat.

DESCRIPTION:Energy Losses and Radiation in Interaction of Relativistic Cha
 rged Particles with Layered Nano-structures\nKamran Akbari\, Department of
  Applied Mathematics\nThe study of the interaction of relativistic charged
  particles with matter at the nano-scale is important since it is at the c
 ore of many problems in Electromagnetic Theory\, Condensed Matter Physics\
 , Nano-science and Technology\, Mathematical Physics\, Electrical Engineer
 ing\, and Material Science. One of the most import configurations for such
  interactions arises in the context of electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (
 EELS) of nano-meter sized specimens within transmission electron microscop
 e.

SUMMARY:On the Theory and Application of Early Warning Signals for Critica

DESCRIPTION:On the Theory and Application of Early Warning Signals for Cri
 tical Transitions\nTom Bury\, Department of Applied Mathematics\nAbrupt an
 d often irreversible transitions can be observed in a wide variety of syst
 ems including ecological communities\, complex disease and social networks
 . These so-called 'critical transitions' can be brought on by a gradual ch
 ange in external conditions that quietly reduce the resilience of a system
 . Despite their seemingly unpredictable nature\, generic early warning sig
 nals have been proposed which\, once verified for a particular system\, co
 uld provide the means for mitigating or even preventing unwanted transitio
 ns. However\, in higher dimensions\, the typical early warning signals can
  become amplified\, muted\, or even reversed\, due to the intricate variab
 le interactions in the approach to the transition. In addition\, these mor
 e complex systems can exhibit a wider variety of transitions to their simp
 lified counterparts. This thesis aims to pin down the mechanisms that caus
 e these particular alterations in early warning signals\, which may then w
 ork in our favour by helping us characterise the transition being approach
 ed. Working alongside models in the social\, ecological and biological sci
 ences\, we hope to contribute the the challenging task of detecting nearby
  critical transitions in these fields.

SUMMARY:From Hopf Algebras to Machine learning via Rough Paths (Colloquium

DESCRIPTION:From Hopf Algebras to Machine learning via Rough Paths\nTerry 
 Lyons\, Oxford University\nRough path theory aims to build an effective ca
 lculus that can model the interactions between complex oscillatory (rough)
  evolving systems. At its mathematical foundations\, it is a combination o
 f analysis blended with algebra that goes back to LC Young\, and to KT Che
 n. Key to the theory is the essential need to incorporate additional non-c
 ommutative structure into areas of mathematics we thought were stable. At 
 its high points\, there are the regularity structures of Martin Hairer tha
 t allow robust meaning to be given to numerous core nonlinear stochastic p
 des describing evolving interfaces in physics.
