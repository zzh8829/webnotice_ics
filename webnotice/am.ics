DESCRIPTION:From Hopf Algebras to Machine learning via Rough Paths\nTerry 
 Lyons\, Oxford University\nam\nColloquium\n\n\nRough path theory aims to b
 uild an effective calculus that can model the interactions between complex
  oscillatory (rough) evolving systems. At its mathematical foundations\, i
 t is a combination of analysis blended with algebra that goes back to LC Y
 oung\, and to KT Chen. Key to the theory is the essential need to incorpor
 ate additional non-commutative structure into areas of mathematics we thou
 ght were stable. At its high points\, there are the regularity structures 
 of Martin Hairer that allow robust meaning to be given to numerous core no
 nlinear stochastic pdes describing evolving interfaces in physics.
