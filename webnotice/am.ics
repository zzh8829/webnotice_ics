DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Ian Tobasco\, University of Michigan\nTitle:   "The 
 cost of crushing: curvature-driven wrinkling of thin elastic shells" \n\nA
 bstract:  How much energy does it take to stamp a thin elastic shell flat?
  Motivated by recent experiments on wrinkling patterns formed by thin floa
 ting shells\, we develop a rigorous method (via Gamma-convergence) for eva
 luating the cost of crushing to leading order in the shells thickness an
 d other small parameters. The observed patterns involve regions of well-de
 fined wrinkling alongside totally disordered regions where no single direc
 tion of wrinkling is preferred. Our goal is to explain the appearance of s
 uch wrinkling domains. Our analysis proves that energetically optimal 
 patterns maximize their projected planar area subject to a shortness const
 raint. This purely geometric variational problem turns out to be explicitl
 y solvable in many cases of interest\, and a strikingly simple scheme for 
 predicting wrinkle patterns results. We demonstrate our methods with concr
 ete examples and offer comparisons with simulation and experiment.\n This 
 talk will be mathematically self-contained\, not assuming prior background
  in elasticity or calculus of variations.  \n \n     \n

SUMMARY:Impacts of relativity on localizability and vacuum entanglement -

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Maria Papageorgiou\, Department  of Applied Mathemat
 ics\, University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Impacts of relativity on localizab
 ility and vacuum entanglement" \n\nAbstract:  Much of the structure of qua
 ntum field theory (QFT) is predicated on the principle of locality. Adhere
 nce to locality is pursuant to convictions deduced from relativity\, and i
 s achieved in QFT by the association of regions of spacetime with algebras
  of observables. Although\, by construction\, the observables of QFT are l
 ocal objects\, one may also consider characterizing the spatial or spaceti
 me features of a state. For example\, if we have a single-particle state\,
  how can we say that the particle is localized in a certain region of spac
 e? It turns out that such a characterization is obstructed by a collection
  of no-go theorems\, which imply the absence of any suitable position oper
 ator or local number operator in the local algebra of observables. These d
 ifficulties seem to suggest that relativistic QFT cannot support an ontolo
 gy in terms of localizable particles.\n Looking towards low energies\, one
  finds the widespread applicability of non-relativistic quantum mechanics 
 (NRQM)\, a theory in which particle states are localizable by means of the
 ir wavefunction. This seems to imply that NRQM can support a particle onto
 logy\, so it is natural to ask whether one can make contact between the NR
 QM description of particles and some appropriate notion in the latent QFT.
  Admittedly QFT amd NRQM are very different theories\, both at the dynamic
 al and kinematical level\, and recovering one from the other cannot come w
 ith no cost. The main undertaking of this thesis will be to illuminate thi
 s connection\, by starting with a relativistic QFT and making suitable app
 roximations to recover features of NRQM.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Weiwei Hu\, Department of Mathematics\, Oklahoma Sta
 te University\nTitle:   "Theoretical and Computational Issues in Control a
 nd Optimization of Fluid Flows" \n\nAbstract:  The first part of my talk f
 ocuses on control and optimization of a thermal fluid modeled by the Bouss
 inesq equations. This work was motivated by the design and operation of lo
 w energy consumption buildings. We investigate the problem of feedback sta
 bilization of a fluid flow in natural convection\, which is important in t
 he theory of hydrodynamical stability. In particular\, we are interested i
 n stabilizing a possible unstable steady state solution to the Boussinesq 
 equations in a two dimensional open and bounded domain. The challenge of s
 tabilization of the Boussinesq equations lies in the stabilization of the 
 Navier-Stokes equations and its coupling with the convection-diffusion equ
 ation for temperature. We show that a finite number of controls acting on 
 a portion of the boundary through Neu-mann/Robin type of boundary conditio
 ns is sufficient to locally stabilize the full nonlinear equations. Numeri
 cal experiments are provided to illustrate the concept and its design. The
  second part of my talk discusses the problem of well-posedness and optima
 l control designs for the Boussinesq equations with zero diffusivity and i
 ts application to control of optimal transport and mixing via flow advecti
 on. The\nchallenges in numerical implementation will be addressed.  \n \n

SUMMARY:Spatially implicit and spatially explicit models of bacterial cell

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Hermann Eberl \, Department of Mathematics and Stat
 istics\, University of Guelph\nTitle:   "Spatially implicit and spatially 
 explicit models of bacterial cellulose degradation" \n\nAbstract:  Cellulo
 sic ethanol is a biofuel that is produced from non-edible plants and plant
  materials\, such switchgrass and corn stover. It can have a positive net 
 energy output with a reduction in green house gas emissions that is drasti
 cally lower than that of cornbased ethanol and fossil fuels. Clostridium t
 hermocellum is a bacteria that is able to directly convert cellulose into 
 ethanol (and other by products). These bacteria colonize cellulose materia
 l and degrade cellulose by "chewing" their way through their substrate. In
  this talk we first present a very simple\, spatially implicit reactor sca
 le model for cellulose degradation by C.thermocellum biofilms. This ODE ca
 n be studied with elementary techniques and quantitatively compared agains
 t experimental data. However\, it does not allow for a detailed descriptio
 n of the spatial effects as the bacteria break down their substratum. To a
 ddress this\, we formulate then a spatially explicit model\, which consist
 s of a highly degenrate diffusion-reaction equation for bacterial biomas t
 hat is couled with an oridnary differential equation for the growth limiti
 ng substrate. We study this model numerically and qualitatively compare si
 mulation results against experimental observations. The simulations sugges
 t the existence of a traveling wave\; time permitting we investigate those
  in a simplified setting in more detail.  \n \n
