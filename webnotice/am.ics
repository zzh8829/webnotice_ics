DESCRIPTION:From Hopf Algebras to Machine learning via Rough Paths\nTerry 
 Lyons\, Oxford University\nColloquium\n\n\nRough path theory aims to build
  an effective calculus that can model the interactions between complex osc
 illatory (rough) evolving systems. At its mathematical foundations\, it is
  a combination of analysis blended with algebra that goes back to LC Young
 \, and to KT Chen. Key to the theory is the essential need to incorporate 
 additional non-commutative structure into areas of mathematics we thought 
 were stable. At its high points\, there are the regularity structures of M
 artin Hairer that allow robust meaning to be given to numerous core nonlin
 ear stochastic pdes describing evolving interfaces in physics.
