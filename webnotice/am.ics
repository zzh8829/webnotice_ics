DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Christine Dow\, Department of Geography & Environmen
 tal Management\, University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Numerical modeling appr
 oaches for examining water flow under ice sheets." \n\nAbstract:  The pres
 ence of water at the bed of the Antarctic ice sheets is known to be a firs
 t order control on the speed of the overlying ice. In many regions\, distr
 ibution and flux of this water is complicated by multi-year storage in sub
 glacial lake basins. With more lakes and pockets of stored water being ide
 ntified every year from satellite surface altimetry measurements and radio
 -echo sounding\, it is apparent that constraining the impact of this water
  is an important step for determining the drivers of Antarctic ice dynamic
 s.\n Using a numerical modeling approach\, I examine the controls on subgl
 acial Antarctic lake growth and drainage within ice streams. I also assess
  whether the drainage of these lakes has an impact on the dynamics of the 
 ice stream. The methods to achieve this utilize GlaDS\, a 2-D finite eleme
 nt subglacial hydrology model\, which incorporates development of a coexis
 ting distributed and efficient drainage system. The model is applied both 
 to a synthetic system and to Recovery Ice Stream in the East Antarctic wit
 h bed topography determined from mass conservation inversion techniques. T
 he model outputs of lake growth and drainage are compared with satellite s
 urface altimetry measurements.  \n \n
