DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Diane Watson\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer S
 cienceTitle: "Reading Garden: A Case Study of an In-Classroom Motivational
  Game"\nAbstract: Textbooks\, as supplementary material\, are known to imp
 rove student outcomes by accommodating multiple learning types and reinfor
 cing material learned in class\; however\, most students do not often comp
 lete assigned readings. We created Reading Garden\, a motivational game ai
 med to get students to read more of the textbook. Reading Garden is a casu
 al\, multiplayer game following common design patterns of many social game
 s. For example\, it follows the free-to-play model\, where the game can al
 ways be played for free\, but has special advanced actions and decorations
  that can be purchased with gold  a special in-game currency. Players ea
 rn gold by completing assigned readings.\nWe then deployed Reading Garden 
 in three iterations of a human computer interaction courses\, in two diffe
 rent departments\, at the University of Waterloo. Each study featured an e
 ntire class playing the game simultaneously throughout the four-month term
 . This talk will discuss the results of those ecologically valid deploymen
 ts\, as well as the ethical challenges associated with conducting studies 
 in classrooms. \n\n      \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Milad Khaki\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer Sc
 ienceTitle: "Bidder Profiling by Acquisition and Analysis of Market Data i
 n Water Distribution Industry"\nAbstract: The project involves the analysi
 s of procurement auctions for water infrastructure maintenance projects fo
 r Cities of Niagara Falls and London. The primary concern of this proposal
  is to generate a reliable mechanism for importing different formats of th
 e tender summaries\, provided as input data\, of the projects and unify th
 em in a database for further exploration and processing. For this part of 
 the research\, I developed a water infrastructure ontology to standardize 
 the different aspects of the knowledge available in this field\, which wou
 ld eventually help us to import the data and look for any contextual incon
 sistencies and errors and act appropriately to repair them.\nThe next part
  of the project\, the primary focus the study\, is to analyze the historic
 al auction data to extract various valuable pieces of information from the
 m such as inflation rate and unit project prices. Also\, it is possible to
  look into generating a profile of each recurrent bidder (contractor) and 
 establish the statistical likelihood model of their behaviour. Therefore\,
  any future auction can be inspected and compared to these profiles and an
 y discrepancies or unexpected or highly unlikely behaviour that would rais
 e a red flag can be found for further investigation. A comprehensive list 
 of features that can act as the indicators of bidder behaviour is presente
 d in this proposal\, as well. The preliminary goal is to minimize the prob
 ability of any possible collusion (or find them if any exists) and detect 
 unusual behaviours that might exist in the procurement auctions. \n\n  \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Silvio Micali\, MITTitle: "ALGORAND\, A New Public Le
 dger"\nAbstract: A public ledger is a tamperproof sequence of data that ca
 n be read and augmented by everyone. Shared public ledgers stand to revolu
 tionize the way a democratic society operates. They secure all kinds of tr
 aditional transactions  such as payments\, asset transfers\, titling  
 in the exact order in which they occur\, and enable totally new transactio
 ns  such as cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. They can remove interm
 ediaries and usher in a new paradigm for trust. As currently implemented\,
  however\, public ledgers cannot achieve their enormous potential.\nAlgora
 nd is a quite alternative\, truly democratic\, and very efficient way to i
 mplement a public ledger. Unlike prior implementations based on proof of w
 ork\, it requires a negligible amount of computation\, and generates a tra
 nsaction history that will not fork with overwhelmingly high probabili
 ty. \n    \nDr. Silvio Micali has received his Laurea in Mat
 hematics from the University of Rome\, and his PhD in Computer Science fro

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Prashant Nalini Vasudevan\, MITTitle: "Average-Case F
 ine-Grained Hardness\, And What To Do With It"\nAbstract: We present funct
 ions that are hard to compute on average for algorithms running in some fi
 xed polynomial time\, assuming widely-conjectured worst-case hardness of c
 ertain problems from the study of fine-grained complexity.\nWe discuss the
  relevance of such average-case hardness to cryptography and present\, as 
 an illustration\, an outline of a proof-of-work protocol constructed based
  on the hardness and certain structural properties of our functions. \nThi
 s work is joint with Marshall Ball\, Alon Rosen and Manuel Sabin.\n 
    \nBio: Prashant Nalini Vasudevan is a student at MIT\, advised
  by Vinod Vaikuntanathan. He is interested broadly in complexity theory an
 d cryptography\, and narrowly in the understanding the fundamentals of com
 plexity-based cryptography\, which involves questions like what sorts of f
 unctions are useful when they are hard and what generic assumptions are ne
 cessary or sufficient to construct various cryptographic objects \n\n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Ivana Kajić\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer S
 cienceTitle: "A Biologically Constrained Model of Semantic Memory Search"\
 nAbstract: The semantic fluency task has been used to understand the effec
 ts of semantic relationships on human memory search. A variety of computat
 ional models have been proposed that explain human behavioral data\, yet i
 t remains unclear how millions of spiking neurons work in unison to realiz
 e the cognitive processes involved in memory search. \nIn this talk\, I wi
 ll present a biologically constrained neural network model that performs t
 he task in a fashion similar to humans. The model reproduces experimentall
 y observed response timing effects\, as well as similarity trends within a
 nd across semantic categories derived from responses. Three different sour
 ces of the association data have been tested by embedding associations in 
 neural connections\, with free association norms providing the best match.
