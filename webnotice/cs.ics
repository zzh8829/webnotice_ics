DESCRIPTION:Adding Mutation to Dependent Object Types\nMarianna Rapoport\,
  David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science\n\nThe Dependent Object Type
 s (DOT) calculus aims to model the essence of Scala\, with a focus on abst
 ract type members\, path-dependent types\, and subtyping. Other Scala feat
 ures could be defined by translation to DOT. Mutation is a fundamental fea
 ture of Scala currently missing in DOT. Mutation in DOT is needed not only
  to model effectful computation and mutation in Scala programs\, but even 
 to precisely specify how Scala initializes immutable variables and fields 
 (vals).

DESCRIPTION:Managing Sensor Data Streams: Lessons Learned from the WeBike 
 Project\nChristian Gorenflo\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science
 \n\nField studies comprising sensor networks pose a multitude of challenge
 s. Robust hardware needs to endure outdoor environments and should change 
 as little as possible during the run of the study because of difficult mai
 ntenance and upgradability. Vast amounts of data generated by the sensor n
 etwork need to be transferred and preprocessed for easier analysis on a hi
 gh-performance system. Depending on the type of data an adequate data mana
 gement platform must be chosen. Lastly\, the software on the edge of the n
 etwork must be updateable over the air to combat data quality issues and e
 xtending sensing capabilities.

DESCRIPTION:ALGORAND\, A New Public Ledger\nSilvio Micali\, MIT\n\nA publi
 c ledger is a tamperproof sequence of data that can be read and augmented 
 by everyone. Shared public ledgers stand to revolutionize the way a democr
 atic society operates. They secure all kinds of traditional transactions 
  such as payments\, asset transfers\, titling  in the exact order in w
 hich they occur\, and enable totally new transactions  such as cryptocur
 rencies and smart contracts. They can remove intermediaries and usher in a
  new paradigm for trust. As currently implemented\, however\, public ledge
 rs cannot achieve their enormous potential.

  study of fine-grained complexity.

 ana Kajić\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science\n\nThe semantic 
 fluency task has been used to understand the effects of semantic relations
 hips on human memory search. A variety of computational models have been p
 roposed that explain human behavioral data\, yet it remains unclear how mi
 llions of spiking neurons work in unison to realize the cognitive processe
 s involved in memory search.

DESCRIPTION:Settling the Query Complexity of Non-adaptive Junta Testing\nE
 rik Waingarten\, Columbia University\n\nIn this talk\, I will show that an
 y non-adaptive algorithm that tests whether an unknown Boolean function f:
 {0\,1}^n→{0\,1} is a k-junta or ϵ-far from every k-junta must make Ω
 (k^(3/2)/ϵ) many queries. This result is essentially optimal given Blais'
 s non-adaptive junta tester\, which makes O(k^(3/2))/ϵ queries and show
 s that adaptivity enables polynomial savings in query complexity for junta
  testing. At a very high level\, the proof proceeds by reducing the non-ad
 aptive junta testing of a new class of random Boolean functions to a probl
 em of distinguishing two binomial distributions with a specific kind of no
 isy query.
