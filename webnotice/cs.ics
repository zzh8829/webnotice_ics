DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Verena Kantere\, School of Electrical Engineering an
 d Computer Science\, University of Ottawa\nTitle:   "Adaptive Scalable Ana
 lytics in Multi-Engine Environments" \n\nAbstract:  Big Data analytics in 
 science and industry are performed on a range of heterogeneous data stores
 \, both traditional and modern\, and on a diversity of query engines. Work
 flows are difficult to design and implement since they span a variety of s
 ystems. To reduce development time and processing costs\, some automation 
 is needed.\n In this talk we will present a new platform to manage analyti
 cs workflows. The platform enables workflow design\, execution\, analysis 
 and optimization with respect to time efficiency\, over multiple execution
  engines. Such configurations are emerging as a common paradigm used to co
 mbine analysis of unstructured data with analysis of structured data (e.g.
 \, NoSQL plus SQL). We focus on the usability of the platform by users wit
 h various expertise\, the automation of the analysis and optimization of e
 xecution\, as well as the effect of optimization on workflow execution. Th
 e platform performs also multi-workflow optimisation and workflow recalibr
 ation. The talk will finish with some plans for future research on data ma
 nagement optimization on hybrid infrastructures\, i.e. infrastructures tha
 t comprise multiple sites heterogeneous parts and combine private clusters
  and public resources.\n      \n Bio : Verena Kantere is an

  Transactions per Second" \n\nAbstract:  Blockchain technologies are expec
 ted to make a significant impact on a variety of industries. However\, one
  issue holding them back is their limited transaction throughput\, especia
 lly compared to established solutions such as distributed database systems
 .  \n In this talk\, we show how to re-architect a modern permissioned blo
 ckchain system\, Hyperledger Fabric\, to increase transaction throughput f
 rom 3\,000 to 20\,000 transactions per second. We focus on performance bot
 tlenecks beyond the consensus mechanism\, and we propose architectural cha
 nges that reduce computation and I/O overhead during transaction ordering 
 and validation to greatly improve throughput. Notably\, our optimizations 
 are fully plug-and-play and do not require any interface changes to Hyperl
 edger Fabric.\n (Joint work with Stephen Lee\, Lukasz Golab\, and S. Kesha

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Jose Serna\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer Sc
 ience\nTitle:   "Dash: Declarative Behavioural Modelling in Alloy" \n\nAbs
 tract:  An abstract model is a representation of the fundamental character
 istics and properties of a system\, and its purpose is to provide feedback
  to stakeholders about the correctness of the system during the early stag
 es of development. This thesis presents Dash\, a new language for the form
 al specification of abstract behavioural models\, which combines the contr
 ol-oriented constructs of statecharts with the declarative modelling of Al
 loy. From statecharts\, Dash inherits a means to specify hierarchy\, concu
 rrency and communication\, three useful aspects to describe the behaviour 
 of reactive systems. From Alloy\, Dash uses the expressiveness of relation
 al logic and set theory to abstractly and declaratively describe structure
 s\, data and operations. \n The purpose of a Dash model is to formally des
 cribe a transition system\, and for this reason transitions are first-clas
 s constructs of the language. Dash provides features such as factoring\, t
 ransition comprehension and layering\, to systematically declare and organ
 ise the transitions of a model. The integration between statecharts and Al
 loy is done in Dash at the semantic level. The semantics of Dash use the n
 otion of big steps and small steps to formally describe changes in a syste
 m\, and address the mismatch between declarative and control-oriented form
 alisms regarding the frame problem. \n We present several case studies to 
 demonstrate the modelling capabilities and automated analysis of Dash mode
 ls. The case studies range from heavily data-oriented systems to highly hi
 erarchical and concurrent systems. Behaviours can be specified using a tem
 poral logic and the Alloy Analyzer is used for performing analyses. We ext
 ended the notion of significance axioms and significant scopes to concurre
 nt Dash models\, to avoid spurious instances of a model and ensure that a 
 big enough search space is explored by the Analyzer to check for interesti
 ng behaviours and provide useful feedback about a model.  \n \n       \n

  University of Florida\nTitle:   "Designing Robust Defenses for Modern Pay

 ated the payment landscape for decades\, empowering the economy. Unfortuna
 tely\, these legacy systems were not designed for today's adversarial envi
 ronment\, and deployment of new technologies is slow\, expensive\, and dif
 ficult to adopt. \n In this talk\, I discuss new ways of identifying and p
 rotecting against real threats to existing payment systems. First\, we wil
 l explore the types of skimmers and how they acquire sensitive card data. 
 We will then examine a use case\, gas pumps\, where skimming remains preva
 lent and how the tools available to consumers for detecting these devices 
 also fail. After characterizing real skimmers\, we use their properties to
  design the Skim Reaper\, the first external skimmer detection system. Fin
 ally\, successful attacks allow counterfeit cards to be created\; I will d
 emonstrate how the most common way to make these cards introduces artifact
 s that can also be detected.  By using attackers' own technology against t
 hem\, these attacks can effectively and inexpensively be reduced.  \n 

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Yashar Ganjali\, Department of Computer Science\, Un
 iversity of Toronto\nTitle:   "The Elephant in the Room  On Effectivenes
 s of Using Elephant Flows For Resource Allocation" \n\nAbstract:  A widely
 -used technique to deal with network resource limitations is to focus on e
 lephant flows. The intuition is that since elephant flows carry most of th
 e packets\, allocating resources to them will lead to significant returns.
  In this talk\, we will take a closer look at this technique\, and argue t
 hat we need to rigorously identify objective and cost functions rather tha
 n simply treating elephant flows as the silver bullet for a wide range of 
 network resource allocation problems. Even though this seems like a trivia
 l statement\, a survey of papers published in top networking conferences s
 hows that it is often overlooked.\n As a case study\, we will focus on the
  problem of limited flow table sizes in OpenFlow switches. Typically\, thi
 s problem is solved by allocating the entries to elephant flows\, and usin
 g default catch-all rules for the rest of traffic. Trying to formally defi
 ne the problem\, we'll show how the optimum solution highly dependents on 
 the objective and cost functions. For specific objective and cost function
 s\, we model the problem as a knapsack problem\, analyze how its solution 
 minimizes the table occupancy\, and show the similarities to and differenc
 es from the default idle timeout mechanism in OpenFlow switches.\n Finally
 \, we present a new approach to minimize flow table occupancy based on the
  insight gained from the knapsack model analysis. Our solution expedites r
 ule eviction by forecasting the TCP flow termination from RST/FIN packets\
 , and delays rule installation by incubating non-TCP flows. It reduces ave
 rage flow table occupancy between 16%-62% in various networks for the negl
 igible cost of less than 1.5% reduction in hit ratio.\n     

 r Science\nTitle:   "Bounds on Maximum Matchings in 1-Planar Graphs" \n\nA
 bstract:  In this thesis\, we study lower bounds on maximum matchings in 1
 -planar graphs. We expand upon the tools used for proofs of matching bound
 s in other classes of graphs as well as some original ideas in order to fi
 nd these bounds. The first novel results we provide are lower bounds of ma
 ximum matching in 1-planar graphs as a function of their minimum degree.\n
  We show that for sufficiently large n\, 1-planar graphs with minimum degr
 ee 3 have a maximum matching of size at least (n+12)/7\, 1-planar graphs w
 ith minimum degree 4 have a maximum matching of size at least (n+4)/3\, an
 d 1-planar graphs with minimum degree 5 have a maximum matching of size at
  least (2n+3)/5. We also give examples of 1-planar graphs with the corresp
 onding minimum degree that meet these bounds\, showing that all of these b
 ounds are tight. We also give examples of 1-planar graphs with small maxim
 um matching and minimum degree 6 and 7. We conjecture that the 1-planar gr
 aph of minimum degree 6 presented has the smallest maximum matching over a
 ll 1-planar graphs of minimum degree 6\, but it is unclear if the method u
 sed for the cases of minimum degree 3\, 4\, and 5 would work for minimum d
 egree 6.\n We also study lower bounds in the class of maximal 1-plane grap
 hs\, and 3-connected maximal 1-plane graphs. We find that 3-connected\, ma
 ximal 1-plane graphs have a maximum matching of size at least (n+4)/3\, an
 d that maximal 1-plane graphs have a maximum matching of size at least (n+
 6)/4. Again\, we present examples of such a graph to show this bound is ti
 ght. We also show that every simple 3-connected maximum 1-planar graph has
  a matching of size at least (2n+6)/5\, and provide some evidence that thi
 s is tight.  \n \n  \n

 us fields of artificial intelligence to the domain of sports management an
 d analysis. The research in this thesis is primarily focused on the entry 
 draft for the National Hockey League\, though many of the models proposed 
 may be applied to other sports and leagues with minimal adjustments. \n A 
 utility model is proposed to define which players are preferred by which t
 eams for a given draft. This model allows for the consideration of how tea
 ms acting in a multiagent system may reason about each other's preferences
 \, as well as how they might strategize and interact with one another thro
 ugh trades. \n A trading scheme where agents may trade picks with each oth
 er to change the picking order is established and an algorithm is proposed
  to find optimal trade offers to propose under an imperfect knowledge sett
 ing. Through simulations based on the National Hockey League Entry Draft d
 ata\, the algorithms provide mutually beneficial trades that also increase
  the social utility of the league over the course of the draft. Machine le
 arning classifiers are proposed to suggest which prospects will be success
 ful at the highest level of the sport over various metrics using statistic
 s and scouting reports from their draft year as features. \n The classifie
 rs outperform conventional draft selections in the NHL and provide insight
 s into which attributes of a player are important in development. Clusteri
 ng techniques are used to determine playstyles in the NHL and these cluste
 rs are fed as annotations into additional classifiers to project which pro
 spects will fall into certain clusters later in their careers. \n These la
 tter classifiers demonstrated promising results but were ultimately limite
 d by the availability of data. A discussion of future avenues of artificia
 l intelligence research in the young but growing field of sports analytics
  is carried throughout this thesis.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Matthew Amy\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer S
 cience\nTitle:   "Formal Methods in Quantum Circuit Design" \n\nAbstract: 
  The design and compilation of correct\, efficient quantum circuits is int
 egral to the future operation of quantum computers. This thesis makes cont
 ributions to the problems of optimizing and verifying quantum circuits\, w
 ith an emphasis on the development of formal models for such purposes. We 
 also present software implementations of these methods\, which together fo
 rm a full stack of tools for the design of optimized\, formally verified q
 uantum oracles.\n On the optimization side\, we study methods for the opti
 mization of Rz and CNOT gates in Clifford+Rz circuits. We develop a genera
 l\, efficient optimization algorithm called phase folding\, which reduces 
 the number of Rz gates without increasing any metrics by computing its pha
 se polynomial. This algorithm can further be combined with synthesis techn
 iques for CNOT-dihedral operators to optimize circuits with respect to par
 ticular costs. We then study the optimal synthesis problem for CNOT-dihedr
 al operators from the perspectives of Rz and CNOT gate optimization. In th
 e case of Rz gate optimization\, we show that the optimal synthesis proble
 m is polynomial-time equivalent to minimum-distance decoding in certain Re
 ed-Muller codes. For the CNOT optimization problem\, we show that the opti
 mal synthesis problem is at least as hard as a combinatorial problem relat
 ed to Gray codes. In both cases\, we develop heuristics for the optimal sy
 nthesis problem\, which together with phase folding reduces T counts by 42
 % and CNOT counts by 21% across a suite of real-world benchmarks.\n From t
 he perspective of formal verification\, we make two contributions. The fir
 st is the development of a novel formal model of quantum circuits with anc
 illary bits\, along with a concrete verification algorithm. The formal mod
 el is based on the Feynman path integral\, and with some syntactic sugar f
 orms a natural specification language for quantum circuits. Our experiment
 s show some practical circuits with up to hundreds of qubits can be effici
 ently verified. Our second contribution is a formally verified\, optimizin
 g compiler for reversible circuits. The compiler compiles a classical\, ir
 reversible language to reversible circuits\, with a formal\, machine-check

 nAbstract:  Organizations are increasingly interested in allowing external
  data scientists to explore their sensitive datasets. Due to the popularit
 y of differential privacy\, data owners want the data exploration to ensur
 e provable privacy guarantees. However\, current systems for differentiall
 y private query answering place an inordinate burden on the data analysts 
 to understand differential privacy\, manage their privacy budget and even 
 implement new algorithms for noisy query answering. Moreover\, current sys
 tems do not provide any guarantees to the data analyst on the quantity the
 y care about\, namely accuracy of query answers.\n In this paper\, we pres
 ent APEx\, a novel system that allows data analysts to pose adaptively cho
 sen sequences of queries along with accuracy bounds. By translating querie
 s and accuracy bounds into differentially private algorithms with the leas
 t privacy loss\, APEx returns query answers to the data analyst that meet 
 the accuracy bounds and proves to the data owner that the entire data expl
 oration process is differentially private. Our comprehensive experimental 
 study on real datasets demonstrates that APEx can answer a variety of quer
 ies accurately with moderate to small privacy loss\, and can support data 
 exploration for performing entity resolution tasks with high accuracy unde
 r reasonable privacy settings.\n This work has been accepted and to appear
  in SIGMOD 2019.  \n \n
