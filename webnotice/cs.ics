DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Marianna Rapoport\, David R. Cheriton School of Comp
 uter Science\nTitle:   "Adding Mutation to Dependent Object Types" \n\nAbs
 tract:  The Dependent Object Types (DOT) calculus aims to model the essenc
 e of Scala\, with a focus on abstract type members\, path-dependent types\
 , and subtyping. Other Scala features could be defined by translation to D
 OT. Mutation is a fundamental feature of Scala currently missing in DOT. M
 utation in DOT is needed not only to model effectful computation and mutat
 ion in Scala programs\, but even to precisely specify how Scala initialize
 s immutable variables and fields (vals). \n We present an extension to DOT
  that adds typed mutable reference cells. We have proven the extension sou
 nd with a mechanized proof in Coq. We present the key features of our exte
 nded calculus and its soundness proof\, and discuss the challenges that we
  encountered in our search for a sound design and the alternative solution
 s that we considered.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Christian Gorenflo\, David R. Cheriton School of Com
 puter Science\nTitle:   "Managing Sensor Data Streams: Lessons Learned fro
 m the WeBike Project" \n\nAbstract:  Field studies comprising sensor netwo
 rks pose a multitude of challenges. Robust hardware needs to endure outdoo
 r environments and should change as little as possible during the run of t
 he study because of difficult maintenance and upgradability. Vast amounts 
 of data generated by the sensor network need to be transferred and preproc
 essed for easier analysis on a high-performance system. Depending on the t
 ype of data an adequate data management platform must be chosen. Lastly\, 
 the software on the edge of the network must be updateable over the air to
  combat data quality issues and extending sensing capabilities. \n This ta
 lk uses the experience from the WeBike project\, a multi-year study at the
  University of Waterloo that includes 31 sensor-equipped electric bikes\, 
 to propose a general framework for similar sensor network studies and pres
 ents specific lessons learned during the run of the project.  \n \n   \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Silvio Micali\, MIT\nTitle:   "ALGORAND\, A New Publ
 ic Ledger" \n\nAbstract:  A public ledger is a tamperproof sequence of dat
 a that can be read and augmented by everyone. Shared public ledgers stand 
 to revolutionize the way a democratic society operates. They secure all ki
 nds of traditional transactions  such as payments\, asset transfers\, ti
 tling  in the exact order in which they occur\, and enable totally new t
 ransactions  such as cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. They can remo
 ve intermediaries and usher in a new paradigm for trust. As currently impl
 emented\, however\, public ledgers cannot achieve their enormous potential
 .\n Algorand is a quite alternative\, truly democratic\, and very efficien
 t way to implement a public ledger. Unlike prior implementations based on 
 proof of work\, it requires a negligible amount of computation\, and gener
 ates a transaction history that will not fork with overwhelmingly high
  probability. \n      \n Dr. Silvio Micali has received his 
 Laurea in Mathematics from the University of Rome\, and his PhD in Compute
 r Science from the University of California at Berkeley. Since 1983 he has
  been on the MIT faculty.\n Silvios research interests are cryptography\
 , zero knowledge\, pseudo-random generation\, secure protocols\, mechanism
  design\, and distributed ledgers. \n Silvio has received the Turing Award

 )\, and the RSA prize (in cryptography). He is a member of the National Ac
 ademy of Sciences\, the National Academy of Engineering\, and the American

 ase Fine-Grained Hardness\, And What To Do With It" \n\nAbstract:  We pres
 ent functions that are hard to compute on average for algorithms running i
 n some fixed polynomial time\, assuming widely-conjectured worst-case hard
 ness of certain problems from the study of fine-grained complexity.\n We d
 iscuss the relevance of such average-case hardness to cryptography and pre
 sent\, as an illustration\, an outline of a proof-of-work protocol constru
 cted based on the hardness and certain structural properties of our functi
 ons. \n This work is joint with Marshall Ball\, Alon Rosen and Manuel Sabi

  MIT\, advised by Vinod Vaikuntanathan. He is interested broadly in comple
 xity theory and cryptography\, and narrowly in the understanding the funda
 mentals of complexity-based cryptography\, which involves questions like w
 hat sorts of functions are useful when they are hard and what generic assu
 mptions are necessary or sufficient to construct various cryptographic obj
 ects  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Ivana Kajić\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer 
 Science\nTitle:   "A Biologically Constrained Model of Semantic Memory Sea
 rch" \n\nAbstract:  The semantic fluency task has been used to understand 
 the effects of semantic relationships on human memory search. A variety of
  computational models have been proposed that explain human behavioral dat
 a\, yet it remains unclear how millions of spiking neurons work in unison 
 to realize the cognitive processes involved in memory search. \n In this t
 alk\, I will present a biologically constrained neural network model that 
 performs the task in a fashion similar to humans. The model reproduces exp
 erimentally observed response timing effects\, as well as similarity trend
 s within and across semantic categories derived from responses. Three diff
 erent sources of the association data have been tested by embedding associ
 ations in neural connections\, with free association norms providing the b
 est match.  \n \n \n

SUMMARY:Settling the Query Complexity of Non-adaptive Junta Testing -  (Al

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Erik Waingarten\, Columbia University\nTitle:   "Set
 tling the Query Complexity of Non-adaptive Junta Testing" \n\nAbstract:  I
 n this talk\, I will show that any non-adaptive algorithm that tests wheth
 er an unknown Boolean function f:{0\,1}^n→{0\,1} is a k-junta or ϵ-far 
 from every k-junta must make Ω(k^(3/2)/ϵ) many queries. This result is
  essentially optimal given Blais's non-adaptive junta tester\, which makes
  O(k^(3/2))/ϵ queries and shows that adaptivity enables polynomial savi
 ngs in query complexity for junta testing. At a very high level\, the proo
 f proceeds by reducing the non-adaptive junta testing of a new class of ra
 ndom Boolean functions to a problem of distinguishing two binomial distrib
 utions with a specific kind of noisy query. \n This is joint work with Xi 
 Chen\, Rocco Servedio\, Li-Yang Tan\, and Jinyu Xie.  \n \n
