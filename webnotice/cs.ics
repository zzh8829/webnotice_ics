DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Cor-Paul Bezemer\, Postdoctoral research fellow\, So
 ftware Analysis and Intelligence Lab\, Queen's University\nTitle:   "Makin
 g Performance Engineering More Accessible to Software Developers" \n\nAbst
 ract:  Performance is extremely important for software systems. For exampl
 e\, a one-second slowdown of the checkout process would cost Amazon $1.6 b
 illion per year. Despite the importance of performance\, all too often it 
 is considered as the last step in product delivery\, and it is often done 
 by operators and system engineers instead of with actual developers. Howev
 er\, many performance-related decisions\, such as those about the configur
 ation and monitoring of a software system\, would benefit tremendously fro
 m the input of software developers. Unfortunately\, many developers are no
 t sufficiently trained to tackle performance challenges in practice.\n In 
 my presentation\, I will discuss why performance engineering and software 
 development should go hand in hand. First\, I highlight examples of perfor
 mance challenges based on several longitudinal studies that we conducted o
 n the Linux kernel and the Steam gaming platform. Then\, I present two exa
 mples of how we can make performance engineering more accessible to develo
 pers. In the first example\, I show how performance analytics can help opt
 imize performance-related configuration options. In the second example\, I
  show how performance analytics can help one make informed decisions about
  the tradeoffs between the amount of information that is being logged in a
  software system and its field performance.\n      \n Bio :

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Micheal Vonn\, BC Civil Liberties Association\nTitle
 :   "CSIS Bulk Data Collection and National Security Surveillance" \n\nAbs
 tract:  Canadians arguably have a much better idea about what kinds of mas
 s surveillance activities are occurring among some of Canada's intelligenc
 e partners in the "Five Eyes" than about what is occurring in Canada. It i
 s clear\, for example\, that the UK's security intelligence has been colle
 cting vast troves of government\, commercial and telecommunications record
 s\, but Canadian practices are relatively unknown. A Canadian Federal Cour
 t ruling in 2016 found the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) t
 o have breached its duty of candour to the court in failing\, for over 10 
 years\, to inform the court that it was indefinitely retaining information
  on third parties unrelated to threats to the security of Canada to add to
  its bulk data holdings. This explosive ruling was delivered during the co
 untry's first ever national security consultation\, which resulted in a sw
 eeping new national security omnibus bill (C-59). This talk will outline h
 ow C-59 proposes to address bulk data collection by Canadian intelligence 
 and talk about the civil liberties implications of the new legal standards
  and accountability mechanisms.\n      \n Bio: Micheal Vonn

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Josef Tkadlec\, PhD candidate\, Institute of Science
  and Technology\, Austria\nTitle:   "Evolutionary Graph Theory" \n\nAbstra
 ct:  Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices with one random vertex coloured bl
 ack and all the other vertices coloured white. In the language of populati
 on genetics\, this corresponds to a single (advantageous) mutant appearing
  in a structured population of indistinguishable residents. Moran process 
 is a certain discrete-time stochastic process that changes the colouring o
 f the vertices in such a way that eventually the vertices become either al
 l white (the mutant went extinct) or all black (the mutant fixated). \
 n Evolutionary graph theory studies how the fixation probability $\\fp(G)$
  depends on the underlying graph structure. For example it is known that $
 \\fp(K_n)=\\fp(C_n)<\\fp(S_n)$ where $K_n$\, $C_n$\, $S_n$ are the complet
 e graph\, the cycle\, and the star\, respectively. In this talk we will gi
 ve an overview of the research done in the field and present some recent r
 esults concerning graphs for which the fixation probability tends to 1 as 
 the number of vertices tends to infinity.  \n \n  \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Shuai Wang\, College of Information Sciences and Tec
 hnology\, Pennsylvania State University\nTitle:   "Identifying Cache-based
  Side Channels in Production Software" \n\nAbstract:  Side-channel attacks
  recover secret information by analyzing the physical implementation of cr
 yptosystems based on non-functional computational characteristics\, e.g. t
 ime\, power\, and acoustic. Among all well-known side channels\, cache-bas
 ed side channels are notoriously severe\, leading to practical attacks aga
 inst certain implementations of theoretically secure crypto algorithms\, s
 uch as RSA\, ElGamal and AES. Such attacks target the hierarchical design 
 of the modern computer memory system\, where different memory access patte
 rns of a program can bring observable cache status difference.\n In this t
 alk\, Shuai Wang will present novel techniques to help software developers
  identify potential vulnerabilities that can lead to cache-based side chan
 nel attacks. The technique leverages constraint solving to detect potentia
 l cache access differences at each program point. He will also describe tw
 o approaches\, which leverage symbolic execution and abstract interpretati
 on to deliver scalable detection of side channels. The proposed techniques
  have been implemented into two practical tools\, and both tools have disc
 overed a large number of known and unknown side-channel vulnerabilities fr
 om real-world cryptosystems. He will conclude by discussing opportunities 
 he is excited to explore in the future\, including supporting the detectio
 n of new side-channel threats\, eliminating side-channel vulnerabilities f
 rom existing software\, and providing new infrastructures for side-channel
  detection on x86 and IoT platforms.\n      \n Bio : Shuai W
 ang is a Ph.D. candidate in the College of Information Sciences and Techno
 logy\, Pennsylvania State University. He is advised by Dinghao Wu. Shuai W
 ang is broadly interested in computer security and specializes in software
  security. The overall goal of his research is to enable building more sec
 ure software systems.\n In addition to publications at top-tier venues for
  Computer Security and Software Engineering\, his work has also achieved n
 otable impacts. For example\, his binary reverse engineering work has been
  adopted and enhanced by two teams among the seven finalists in the 2016 D
 ARPA Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) competition.  \n \n     \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Ricardo Salmon\, David R. Cheriton School of Compute
 r Science\nTitle:   "From SAT to Stochastic SAT" \n\nAbstract:  Stochastic
  satisfiability (SSAT) problems are an extension of SAT problems that is P
 SPACE-complete and in the same complexity class as quantified Boolean form
 ula (QBF) and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs).\n W
 e show how to extend techniques from SAT into a stochastic solver called P
 rime\, that solves probabilistic inference and POMDP problems. Similar to 
 SAT and other NP-hard problems\, where a lot of research has been invested
 \, we hope to encourage further research into SSAT. The results show that 
 our solver is able to tackle large problems and is very competitive.  \n \

SUMMARY:Faster Approximate  Diameter and Distance Oracles in Planar Graphs

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Dimitrios Skrepetos\, David R. Cheriton School of Co
 mputer Science\nTitle:   "Faster Approximate  Diameter and Distance Oracle
 s in Planar Graphs" \n\nAbstract:  We present an algorithm that computes a
  (1+\\varepsilon)-approximation of the diameter of a weighted\, undirected
  planar graph of n vertices with non-negative edge lengths in O(n \\log n 
 (\\log n + (1/\\varepsilon)^5)) expected time\, improving upon the O(n ((1
 /\\varepsilon)^4 \\log^4 n + 2^{O(1/\\varepsilon)}))-time algorithm of Wei
 mann and Yuster [ICALP 2013]. \n Our algorithm makes two improvements over
  that result: first and foremost\, it replaces the exponential dependency 
 on 1/\\varepsilon with a polynomial one\, by adapting and specializing Cab
 ello's recent abstract-Voronoi-diagram-based technique [SODA 2017] for app
 roximation purposes\; second\, it shaves off two logarithmic factors by ch
 oosing a better sequence of error parameters  during recursion. \n Moreove
 r\, using similar techniques\, we improve the (1+\\varepsilon)-approximate
  distance oracle of Gu and Xu [ISAAC 2015] by first replacing the exponent
 ial dependency on 1/\\varepsilon on the preprocessing time and space with 
 a polynomial one and second removing a logarithmic factor from the preproc
 essing time.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Pedram Ghodsnia\, David R. Cheriton School of Comput
 er Science\nTitle:   "Effective Use of SSDs in Database Systems" \n\nAbstr
 act:  With the advent of solid state drives (SSDs)\, the storage industry 
 has experienced a revolutionary improvement in I/O performance. Compared t
 o traditional hard disk drives (HDDs)\, SSDs benefit from shorter I/O late
 ncy\, better power efficiency\, and cheaper random I/Os. Because of these 
 superior properties\, SSDs are gradually replacing HDDs. For decades\, dat
 abase management systems have been designed\, architected\, and optimized 
 based on the performance characteristics of HDDs.  In order to utilize the
  superior performance of SSDs\, new methods should be developed\, some dat
 abase components should be redesigned\, and architectural decisions should
  be revisited.\n In this thesis\, novel methods are proposed to exploit th
 e new capabilities of modern SSDs to improve the performance of database s
 ystems. The first is a new method for using SSDs as a fully persistent sec
 ond level memory buffer pool. This method uses SSDs as a supplementary sto
 rage device to improve transactional throughput and to reduce the checkpoi
 nt and recovery times. A prototype of the proposed method is compared with
  its closest existing competitor. The second considers the impact of the p
 arallel I/O capability of modern SSDs on the database query optimizer. It 
 is shown that a query optimizer that is unaware of the parallel I/O capabi
 lity of SSDs can make significantly sub-optimal decisions. In addition\, a
  practical method for making the query optimizer parallel-I/O-aware is int
 roduced and evaluated empirically. The third technique is an SSD-friendly 
 external merge sort. This sorting technique has better performance than ot
 her common external sorting techniques. It also improves the SSD's lifespa
 n by reducing the number of write operations required during sorting.  \n
