DESCRIPTION:Reading Garden: A Case Study of an In-Classroom Motivational G
 ame\nDiane Watson\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science\ncs\nHuma
 n-Computer Interaction PhD Seminar\n\n\nTextbooks\, as supplementary mater
 ial\, are known to improve student outcomes by accommodating multiple lear
 ning types and reinforcing material learned in class\; however\, most stud
 ents do not often complete assigned readings. We created Reading Garden\, 
 a motivational game aimed to get students to read more of the textbook. Re
 ading Garden is a casual\, multiplayer game following common design patter
 ns of many social games. For example\, it follows the free-to-play model\,
  where the game can always be played for free\, but has special advanced a
 ctions and decorations that can be purchased with gold  a special in-gam
 e currency. Players earn gold by completing assigned readings.

DESCRIPTION:Bidder Profiling by Acquisition and Analysis of Market Data in
  Water Distribution Industry\nMilad Khaki\, David R. Cheriton School of Co
 mputer Science\ncs\nArtificial Intelligence Lab PhD Seminar\n\n\nThe proje
 ct involves the analysis of procurement auctions for water infrastructure 
 maintenance projects for Cities of Niagara Falls and London. The primary c
 oncern of this proposal is to generate a reliable mechanism for importing 
 different formats of the tender summaries\, provided as input data\, of th
 e projects and unify them in a database for further exploration and proces
 sing. For this part of the research\, I developed a water infrastructure o
 ntology to standardize the different aspects of the knowledge available in
  this field\, which would eventually help us to import the data and look f
 or any contextual inconsistencies and errors and act appropriately to repa
 ir them.

DESCRIPTION:ALGORAND\, A New Public Ledger\nSilvio Micali\, MIT\ncs\nDisti
 nguished Lecture Series Seminar\n\n\nA public ledger is a tamperproof sequ
 ence of data that can be read and augmented by everyone. Shared public led
 gers stand to revolutionize the way a democratic society operates. They se
 cure all kinds of traditional transactions  such as payments\, asset tra
 nsfers\, titling  in the exact order in which they occur\, and enable to
 tally new transactions  such as cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. Th
 ey can remove intermediaries and usher in a new paradigm for trust. As cur
 rently implemented\, however\, public ledgers cannot achieve their enormou
 s potential.

 widely-conjectured worst-case hardness of certain problems from the study 
 of fine-grained complexity.

 ana Kajić\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science\ncs\nArtificial 
 Intelligence Lab PhD Seminar\n\n\nThe semantic fluency task has been used 
 to understand the effects of semantic relationships on human memory search
 . A variety of computational models have been proposed that explain human 
 behavioral data\, yet it remains unclear how millions of spiking neurons w
 ork in unison to realize the cognitive processes involved in memory search
 .
