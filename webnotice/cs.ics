DESCRIPTION:Contact Representation of Planar Graphs in 2D and 3D\nStephen 
 Kobourov\, Department of Computer Science\, University of Arizona\nIn a pr
 oportional contact representation of a planar graph\, each vertex is repre
 sented by a simple polygon with area proportional to a given weight\, and 
 edges are represented by adjacencies between the corresponding pairs of po
 lygons. We show how to use Schnyder realizers and canonical orders for pla
 nar graphs to obtain different types of contact representations. Specifica
 lly\, we describe an algorithm that constructs proportional contact repres
 entation for arbitrary planar graphs using 10-sided rectilinear polygons. 
 We also describe a construction with 8-sided polygons\, which is optimal i
 n terms of polygonal complexity\, as 8-sided polygons are sometimes necess
 ary. In 3D vertices are represented by polytopes and edges by contacts bet
 ween the corresponding polytopes contacts. We show that planar 3-trees hav
 e contact representations with cubes and proportional contact representati
 ons with boxes.

DESCRIPTION:DBMS as a Bioinformatics Application Platform\nEvguenia Eflov\
 , David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science\nWith recent advancements i
 n technology\, bioinformatics applications have to process and manage cons
 tantly growing amounts of data. Applications developed for a single proces
 sing node may not be sufficient to handle the demands of the current data 
 volume. Several processing frameworks that aim to overcome the limitations
  of a single computer have been proposed and used\, with MapReduce\, MPI a
 nd GPU-based being the most utilized. Of the three\, MapReduce is most fre
 quently used in practice\; however\, there are limitations to usefulness o
 f the framework\, most notably\, the required structure of the application
  tasks executed in the framework.

 ccommodating multiple learning types and reinforcing material learned in c

  created Reading Garden\, a motivational game aimed to get students to rea

 but has special advanced actions and decorations that can be purchased wit

DESCRIPTION:ALGORAND\, A New Public Ledger\nSilvio Micali\, MIT\nA public 
 ledger is a tamperproof sequence of data that can be read and augmented by
  everyone. Shared public ledgers stand to revolutionize the way a democrat
 ic society operates. They secure all kinds of traditional transactions  
 such as payments\, asset transfers\, titling  in the exact order in whic
 h they occur\, and enable totally new transactions  such as cryptocurren
 cies and smart contracts. They can remove intermediaries and usher in a ne
 w paradigm for trust. As currently implemented\, however\, public ledgers 
 cannot achieve their enormous potential.

 posed that explain human behavioral data\, yet it remains unclear how mill
 ions of spiking neurons work in unison to realize the cognitive processes 
 involved in memory search.
