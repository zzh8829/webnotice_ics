DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Yongjoo Park\, Research Fellow\, Computer Science an
 d Engineering\, University of Michigan\nTitle:   "Bringing Statistical Tra
 deoffs to Data Systems" \n\nAbstract:  Despite advances in computing power
 \, the cost of large-scale analytics and machine learning remains daunting
  to small and large enterprises alike. This has created a pressing demand 
 for reducing infrastructure costs and query latencies. To meet these goals
 \, data analysts and applications are in many cases willing to tolerate a 
 slight  but controlled  degradation of accuracy in exchange for substa
 ntial gains in cost and performance\, which we refer to as statistical tra
 deoffs. This is particularly true in the early stages of data exploration 
 and is in stark contrast to traditional tradeoffs where the infrastructure
  costs must increase for higher performance.\n My research builds large-sc
 ale data systems that can make these statistical tradeoffs in a principled
  manner. In this talk\, I will focus on two specific directions. First\, I
  will present VerdictDB\, a system that enables quality-guaranteed\, stati
 stical tradeoffs without any changes to backend infrastructure\; thus\, it
  offers a universal solution for off-the-shelf query engines. Second\, I w
 ill introduce Database Learning\, a new query execution paradigm that allo
 ws existing query engines to constantly learn from their past executions a
 nd become smarter over time without any user intervention. I will conc
 lude by briefly discussing other promising directions with emerging worklo
 ads beyond SQL\, including visualization and machine learning. \n  

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  John Wright\, Postdoctoral fellow\, Center for Theor
 etical Physics\, MIT\nTitle:   "How to Learn a Quantum State" \n\nAbstract
 :  In the area of quantum state learning\, one is given a small number of 
 "samples" of a quantum state\, and the goal is use them to determine a fea
 ture of the state. Examples include learning the entire state ("quantum st
 ate tomography")\, determining whether it equals a target state ("quantum 
 state certification")\, or estimating its von Neumann entropy. These are p
 roblems which are not only of theoretical interest\, but are also commonly
  used in current-day implementation and verification of quantum technologi
 es. \n In this talk\, I will describe my work giving efficient algorithms 
 for a variety of these problems\, including the first optimal algorithms f
 or tomography and state certification. My results make use of a new connec
 tion between quantum state learning and longest increasing subsequences of
  random words\, a famous topic in combinatorics dating back to a 1935 pape
 r of Erdős and Szekeres. Motivated by this connection\, I will show new a
 nd optimal bounds on the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a
  random word.\n      \n Bio : John Wright got his B.Sc. from

 nt in Computer Systems" \n\nAbstract:  Resource sharing is vital to improv
 ing efficiency and amortizing cost in high-performance computer systems. W
 ithin modern computer systems\, users selfishly pursue individual performa
 nce without regard for others or the system. To address this challenge and
  study the strategic behaviour of self-interested users\, we turn to algor
 ithmic economics and game theory. \n In this talk\, we rethink resource ma
 nagement in computer systems\, constructing mechanisms that are robust to 
 strategic behaviour. We first discuss some novel methods to manage shared 
 resources in modern data centers. We then talk about game-theoretic learni
 ng models and explore their applications in resource management.\n  

  without relying on payment processing monopolies and central banks as int
 ermediaries\, today they are starting to be used for a much wider array of
  applications\, and a whole science\, combining elements of cryptography\,
  distributed systems and game theory\, is forming around how to design blo
 ckchain-based applications in different contexts.\n      \n

 auty of computer-generated images in movies and advertisements today. It i
 s\, however\, not immediately obvious that generation of such visually app
 ealing images is based on equally (but scientifically) appealing numerical
  algorithms and theories. For example\, photorealistic images are based on
  accurate simulation of light transport\, which can be formulated as a rec
 ursive integral equation with no trivial analytical solution. One of the c
 ore problems in computer graphics is to solve this equation as efficiently
  and accurately as possible.\n In this talk\, I will explain the body of o
 ur work which led to a unification of various algorithms for light transpo
 rt simulation. Our study of mathematical connections among the different c
 lasses of the algorithms resulted in some of the most robust light transpo
 rt simulation algorithms we have today. I will discuss how our insights fr
 om light transport simulation are applicable to more general problems in n
 umerical analysis\, and how further research will potentially lead to bett
 er understandings of both light transport simulation and numerical analysi

 nce\nTitle:   "End-to-end Neural Information Retrieval" \n\nAbstract:  In 
 recent years\, we have witnessed many successes of neural networks in the 
 information retrieval community with lots of labeled data. Yet it remains 
 unknown whether the same techniques can be easily adapted to search social
  media posts where the text is much shorter. In addition\, we find that mo
 st neural information retrieval models are compared against weak baselines
 . \n In this thesis\, we build an end-to-end neural information retrieval 
 system using two toolkits: Anserini and MatchZoo. In addition\, we also pr
 opose a novel neural model to capture the relevance of short and varied tw
 eet text\, named MP-HCNN. \n With the information retrieval toolkit Anseri
 ni\, we build a reranking architecture based on various traditional inform
 ation retrieval models (QL\, QL+RM3\, BM25\, BM25+RM3)\, including a stron
 g IR baseline: RM3. With the neural network toolkit MatchZoo\, we offer an
  empirical study of a number of popular neural network ranking models (DSS
 M\, CDSSM\, KNRM\, DUET\, DRMM). Experiments on datasets from the TREC Mic
 roblog Tracks and TREC Robust Retrieval Track show that \\textit{most} exi
 sting neural network models cannot beat a simple language model baseline. 
 However\, DRMM provides a significant improvement over the baseline (BM25+
 RM3) on the Robust04 dataset and DUET\, DRMM and MP-HCNN can provide signi
 ficant improvements over the baseline (QL+RM3) on the microblog datasets. 
 \n Further detailed analyses suggest that searching social media and searc
 hing news articles exhibit several different characteristics that require 
 customized model design\, shedding light on future work.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Haotian Zhang\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer
  Science\nTitle:   "Increasing the Efficiency of High-Recall Information R
 etrieval" \n\nAbstract:  The problem of high-recall information retrieval 
 (HRIR) is to find all\, or nearly all\, relevant documents while ensuring
  reasonable assessment effort. Achieving high recall is a key problem for 
 applications such as electronic discovery\, systematic review\, and the c
 onstruction of test collections for information retrieval tasks.  \n The
  current state-of-the-art HRIR systems commonly rely on iterative relevan
 ce feedback\, in which human assessors keep assessing machine learning sel
 ected documents. The relevance of assessed documents are then fed back to 
 improve the machine learned model for selecting the next most likely to be
  relevant documents for assessments. In many instances\, thousands of hum
 an assessments might be required to achieve high recall. These assessments
  represent the main cost of such HRIR applications. Therefore\, the effect
 iveness to achieve high recall of such HRIR methods are limited by their 
 reliance on human input\, i.e.\, to assess the relevance of documents.  \
 n In this thesis\, we try different methods to improve the effectiveness a
 nd efficiency of finding relevant documents for the current state-of-the-a
 rt HRIR system. With regard to the effectiveness\, we try to build an effe
 ctive machine learned model to retrieve relevant documents more accurately
 . On the other hand\, for the efficiency\, we try to help human assessor m
 ake relevance assessments more easily and quickly via our HRIR system. Fur
 thermore\, we also try to establish a stopping criteria in the assessment 
 process so as to avoid excessive assessments. In particular\, we hypothesi
 ze that the total assessment effort to achieve high recall can be reduced 
 by using shorter document excerpts\, e.g.\, extractive summaries\, in plac
 e of full documents for the assessments of relevance as part of a high-rec
 all retrieval system based on continuous active learning (CAL). \n In orde
 r to test this hypothesis\, we implemented a high-recall retrieval system 
 based on the current state-of-the art implementation of CAL. This high-re
 call retrieval system could display either full documents or short documen
 t excerpts for relevance assessments. A search engine was also integrated 
 into our system to provide the option for assessors to conduct interactive
  search and judging. \n We conducted a simulation study and a 50-person\,
  controlled user study separately to test our hypothesis. The results from
  the simulation study show that even judging a single extracted sentence f
 or relevance feedback may be adequate for CAL to achieve high recall. The
  results of the controlled user study further confirmed that human assesso
 rs were able to find a significantly larger number of relevant documents w
 hen they used the a system with paragraph-length document excerpts as oppo
 sed to full documents within a limited time. In addition\, we found that 
 allowing participants to compose and execute their own search queries did 
 not improve their ability to find relevant documents and\, by some measure
 s\, impaired performance. Moreover\, we also found that integrating sampli
 ng methods with active learning can yield accurate estimates of the number
  of relevant documents\, and thus to further avoid excessive assessments.

 ience\nTitle:   "C∀ Type System Implementation" \n\nAbstract:  The C pro
 gramming language has been an important software development tool for deca
 des. C∀ is a new programming language designed with strong backwards-com
 patibility to take advantage of widely distributed C programming expertise
  and the large deployed base of C code\, paired with modern language featu
 res to improve developer productivity.\n This thesis presents a number of 
 improvements to C∀. The author has developed one major new language feat
 ure\, generic types\, in a way that integrates naturally with both the exi
 sting polymorphism features of C∀ and the translation-unit-based encapsu
 lation model of C. This thesis also presents a number of smaller refinemen
 ts to the C∀ overload resolution rules\, each of which improves the expr
 essivity or intuitive nature of the language.\n This thesis also includes 
 a number of practical improvements to C∀ compilation performance\, focus
 ed on the expression resolution pass\, which is the main bottleneck. These
  include better algorithms for argument-parameter matching and type assert
 ion satisfaction\, as well as a new type-environment data-structure based 
 on a novel variant of union-find. The compilation performance improvements
  have all been experimentally validated with a new prototype system that e
 ncapsulates the key aspects of the C∀ language\; this prototype is a pro
 mising basis for future research and a technical contribution of this work

  Science\nTitle:   "Systems for Guiding Work-Related Attention" \n\nAbstra
 ct:   Part I: Guiding Attention between Home and the Workplace \n Research
  has shown that productivity is mediated by an individuals ability to de
 tach from their work at the end of the day and reattach with it when they 
 return the next day. In this paper we explore the extent to which structur
 ed dialogues\, focused on individuals work-related tasks or emotions\, c
 an help them with the detachment and reattachment processes. Our inquiry i
 s driven with SwitchBot\, a conversational bot which engages with workers 
 at the start and end of their work day. \n After preliminarily validating 
 the design of a detachment and reattachment dialogue framework with 108 cr
 owdworkers\, we study SwitchBots use  in-situ  for 14 days with 34 infor
 mation workers. We find that workers send fewer e-mails after work hours a
 nd spend a larger percentage of their first hour at work using productivit
 y applications than they normally would when using SwitchBot. Further\, we
  find that productivity gains were better sustained when conversations foc
 used on work-related emotions. Our results suggest that conversational bot
 s can be effective tools for aiding workplace detachment and reattachment 
 and help people make successful use of their time on and off the job.\n Pa
 rt II: Guiding Attention for Programmers with On-the-Go Experiences \n Res
 earch has given much attention to software and tools in support of enhanci
 ng programmers' productivity within their workspace. In this paper\, we ex
 plore opportunities to help programmers make productive use of their time 
 while away from their workspace. We interviewed 10 software engineers and 
 conducted a survey with 78 software engineers to identify opportunities fo
 r supporting programmers on-the-go. \n Based on the interviews and survey\
 , we introduce \\textit{Mercury}\, a system that guides programmers in mak
 ing progress on-the-go with auto-generated microtasks based on their sourc
 e code's current state. Studying Mercury with 20 full-time programmers\, w
 e highlight the strengths and shortcomings of the system and discuss direc
 tions for future work. Our findings have implications for the design of fu
 ture software engineering tools that allow programmers to make progress on
  their work while away from their primary workstation.  \n \n
