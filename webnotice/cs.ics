SUMMARY:Contact Representation of Planar Graphs in 2D and 3D (Algorithms and Complexity Group Seminar)
LOCATION:DC 1304
DESCRIPTION:Contact Representation of Planar Graphs in 2D and 3D\nStephen Kobourov, Department of Computer Science, University of Arizona\n\nIn a proportional contact representation of a planar graph, each vertex is represented by a simple polygon with area proportional to a given weight, and edges are represented by adjacencies between the corresponding pairs of polygons. We show how to use Schnyder realizers and canonical orders for planar graphs to obtain different types of contact representations. Specifically, we describe an algorithm that constructs proportional contact representation for arbitrary planar graphs using 10-sided rectilinear polygons. We also describe a construction with 8-sided polygons, which is optimal in terms of polygonal complexity, as 8-sided polygons are sometimes necessary. In 3D vertices are represented by polytopes and edges by contacts between the corresponding polytopes contacts. We show that planar 3-trees have contact representations with cubes and proportional contact representations with boxes.BEGIN:VEVENT

SUMMARY:Open Challenges in Data Science (Computer Science Seminar)
LOCATION:MC 5501
DESCRIPTION:Open Challenges in Data Science\nEugene Wen, David Kierstead\n\nThe talk will be followed by a networking reception in MC 5501.\n\nManulifes Advanced Analytics teams translate complex data into insights. We use machine learning and other predictive modelling techniques to predict the likelihood of future events and optimize outcomes. Four use cases we believe data science can improve the customer experience are:BEGIN:VEVENT

SUMMARY:DBMS as a Bioinformatics Application Platform (Bioinformatics Group Master's Essay Presentation)
LOCATION:DC 3317
DESCRIPTION:DBMS as a Bioinformatics Application Platform\nEvguenia Eflov, David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science\n\nWith recent advancements in technology, bioinformatics applications have to process and manage constantly growing amounts of data. Applications developed for a single processing node may not be sufficient to handle the demands of the current data volume. Several processing frameworks that aim to overcome the limitations of a single computer have been proposed and used, with MapReduce, MPI and GPU-based being the most utilized. Of the three, MapReduce is most frequently used in practice; however, there are limitations to usefulness of the framework, most notably, the required structure of the application tasks executed in the framework.BEGIN:VEVENT

SUMMARY:Genome Matrices and the Median Problem (Algorithms and Complexity Group Seminar)
LOCATION:DC 1304
DESCRIPTION:Genome Matrices and the Median Problem\nJoao Meidanis, University of Campinas\n\nThe genome median problem is an important problem in phylogenetic reconstruction under rearrangement models. It can be stated as follows: Given three genomes, find a fourth that minimizes the sum of the pairwise rearrangement distances between it and the three input genomes.BEGIN:VEVENT

SUMMARY:Reading Garden: A Case Study of an In-Classroom Motivational Game (Human-Computer Interaction PhD Seminar)
LOCATION:DC 2310
DESCRIPTION:Reading Garden: A Case Study of an In-Classroom Motivational Game\nDiane Watson, David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science\n\nTextbooks, as supplementary material, are known to improve student outcomes by accommodating multiple learning types and reinforcing material learned in class; however, most students do not often complete assigned readings. We created Reading Garden, a motivational game aimed to get students to read more of the textbook. Reading Garden is a casual, multiplayer game following common design patterns of many social games. For example, it follows the free-to-play model, where the game can always be played for free, but has special advanced actions and decorations that can be purchased with gold  a special in-game currency. Players earn gold by completing assigned readings.BEGIN:VEVENT

SUMMARY:ALGORAND, A New Public Ledger (Distinguished Lecture Series Seminar)
LOCATION:DC 1302
DESCRIPTION:ALGORAND, A New Public Ledger\nSilvio Micali, MIT\n\nA public ledger is a tamperproof sequence of data that can be read and augmented by everyone. Shared public ledgers stand to revolutionize the way a democratic society operates. They secure all kinds of traditional transactions  such as payments, asset transfers, titling  in the exact order in which they occur, and enable totally new transactions  such as cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. They can remove intermediaries and usher in a new paradigm for trust. As currently implemented, however, public ledgers cannot achieve their enormous potential.BEGIN:VEVENT

DESCRIPTION:Average-Case Fine-Grained Hardness, And What To Do With It\nPrashant Nalini Vasudevan, MIT\n\nWe present functions that are hard to compute on average for algorithms running in some fixed polynomial time, assuming widely-conjectured worst-case hardness of certain problems from the study of fine-grained complexity.BEGIN:VEVENT

SUMMARY:A Biologically Constrained Model of Semantic Memory Search (Artificial Intelligence Lab PhD Seminar)
LOCATION:DC 2310
DESCRIPTION:A Biologically Constrained Model of Semantic Memory Search\nIvana Kajić, David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science\n\nThe semantic fluency task has been used to understand the effects of semantic relationships on human memory search. A variety of computational models have been proposed that explain human behavioral data, yet it remains unclear how millions of spiking neurons work in unison to realize the cognitive processes involved in memory search.
