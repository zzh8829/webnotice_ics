DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Lesley Istead\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer
  Science\nTitle:   "Nonphotorealistic Rendering of Stereoscopic 3D Media" 
 \n\nAbstract:  We present a method for stylizing stereoscopic 3D images th
 at guarantees consistency between the left and right views. Our method dec
 omposes the left and right views of an input image into discretized dispar
 ity layers and merges the corresponding layers from the left and right vie
 ws into a single layer where stylization takes place. We then construct ne
 w stylized left and right views by compositing portions of the stylized la
 yers. Because the left and right views come from the same source layers\, 
 our method eliminates common artifacts that cause viewer discomfort. We al
 so present a stereoscopic 3D painterly rendering algorithm tailored to our
  layer-based approach. This method uses disparity information to assist in
  stroke creation so that strokes follow surface geometry without ignoring 
 painted surface patterns.  \n \n     \n

  of offline two-phase supervised learning and online human-in-the-loop act
 ive learning. While most existing research proposes offline supervision or
  hand-crafted reward functions for online reinforcement\, we devise a nove
 l interactive learning mechanism based on hamming-diverse beam search for 
 response generation and one-character user-feedback at each step. Experime
 nts show that our model inherently promotes the generation of semantically
  relevant and interesting responses\, and can be used to train agents with
  customized personas\, moods and conversational styles. \n Published as a

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Martin Derka\, David. R. Cheriton School of Computer
  Science\nTitle:   "Restricted String Representations" \n\nAbstract:  A st
 ring representation of a graph assigns to every vertex a curve in the plan
 e so that two curves intersect if and only if the represented vertices are
  adjacent. This work investigates string representations of graphs with an
  emphasis on the shapes of curves and the way they  intersect. We strength
 en some previously known results and show that every planar graph has stri
 ng representations where every curve consists of axis-parallel line segmen
 ts with at most two bends (those are the so-called  $B_2$-VPG representati
 ons) and simultaneously two curves intersect each other at most once (thos
 e are the so-called 1-string representations). Thus\, planar graphs are $B
 _2$-VPG $1$-string graphs.  \n We further show that with some restrictions
  on the shapes of the curves\, string representations can be used to produ
 ce approximation algorithms for several hard problems. The $B_2$-VPG repre
 sentations of planar graphs satisfy these restrictions. We attempt to furt
 her restrict the number of bends in VPG representations for subclasses of 
 planar graphs\, and investigate $B_1$-VPG representations. \n We propose  
 new classes of string representations for planar graphs that we call "orde
 r-preserving.'' Order-preservation is an interesting property that relates
  the string representation to the planar embedding of the graph\, and we b
 elieve that it might prove useful when constructing string representations
 . Finally\, we extend our investigation of string representations to strin
 g representations that require some curves to intersect multiple times. We
  show that there are outer-string graphs that require an exponential numbe
 r of crossings in their outer-string representations. Our construction als
 o proves that 1-planar graphs\, i.e.\, graphs that are no longer planar\, 
 yet fairly close to planar graphs\, may have string representations\, but 
 they are not always 1-string.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Ryan Goldade\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer 
 Science\nTitle:   "Constraint Bubbles: Adding Efficient Zero-Density Bubbl
 es to Incompressible Free Surface Flow" \n\nAbstract:  Liquid simulations 
 for computer animation often avoid simulating the air phase to reduce comp
 utational costs and ensure good conditioning of the linear systems require
 d to enforce incompressibility. However\, this free surface assumption lea
 ds to an inability to realistically treat bubbles: submerged gaps in the l
 iquid are interpreted as empty voids that immediately collapse. To address
  this shortcoming\, I will present an efficient\, practical\, and conceptu
 ally simple approach to augment free surface flows with negligible density
  bubbles. Our method adds a new constraint to each disconnected air region
  that guarantees zero net flux across its entire surface\, and requires ne
 ither simulating both phases nor reformulating into stream function variab
 les. Implementation of the method requires only minor modifications to the
  pressure solve of a standard grid-based fluid solver\, and yields linear 
 systems that remain sparse and symmetric positive definite. \n In our eval
 uations\, solving the modified pressure projection system took no more tha
 n 10% longer than the corresponding free surface solve. We demonstrate the
  methods effectiveness and flexibility by incorporating it into commerci
 al fluid animation software and using it to generate a variety of dynamic 
 bubble scenarios showcasing glugging effects\, viscous and inviscid bubble
 s\, interactions with irregularly-shaped and moving solid boundaries\, and
  surface tension effects.  \n \n \n

 ience\nTitle:   "Naive Bayes Data Complexity and Characterization of Optim
 a of the  Unsupervised Expected Likelihood" \n\nAbstract:  The naive Bayes
  model is a simple model that has been used for many decades\, often as a 
 baseline\, for both supervised and unsupervised learning. With a latent cl
 ass variable it is one of the simplest latent variable models\, and is oft
 en used for clustering. The estimation of its parameters by maximum likeli
 hood (e.g.\, gradient ascent\, expectation maximization) is subject to loc
 al optima since the objective is non-concave. However\, the conditions und
 er which global optimality can be guaranteed are currently unknown.  \n I 
 provide a first characterization of the optima of the naive Bayes model. F
 or problems with up to three features\, I describe comprehensive condition
 s that ensure global optimality. For more than three features\, I show tha
 t all stationary points exhibit marginal distributions with respect to the
  features that match those of the training data. In a second line of work\
 , I consider the naive Bayes model with an observed class variable\, which
  is often used for classification. Well-known results provide some upper b
 ounds on the sample complexity for agnostic PAC learning\, however exact b
 ounds are unknown. These bounds would show exactly how much data is needed
  for model training.  I detail the framework for determining an exact tigh
 t bound on sample complexity\, and prove some of the sub-theorems that thi
 s framework rests on. I also provide some insight into the nature of the d
 istributions that are hardest to model within specified accuracy parameter
 s.  \n \n \n

 cience\nTitle:   "Animating Coupling Between Inviscid Free-Surface Liquids
  and Elastic Deformable Bodies" \n\nAbstract:  Driven by demand for high-f
 idelity computer-generated imagery\, physics-based animation has become an
  exciting frontier of research in computer science. Simulations of fluids 
 and their interactions with other objects in the environment have particul
 arly enjoyed much attention and investigation. Consequently\, effective te
 chniques have been developed to efficiently simulate two-way coupling betw
 een fluids and rigid bodies\, allowing for convincing animation of\, for i
 nstance\, ships on the ocean. On the other hand\, accurately capturing int
 eractions between fluids and deformable solids has proven to be much more 
 elusive. In particular\, satisfaction of boundary conditions poses a signi
 ficant difficulty\, as the straightforward voxelized treatment suffers fro
 m visible grid artefacts\, whereas use of a conforming mesh greatly increa
 ses the computational overhead of a simulation.\n We investigate the probl
 em of animating two-way coupling effects between free-surface liquids and 
 linearly elastic solids. Aside from presenting simulation techniques for s
 uch liquids and solids separately\, we introduce a new approach to simulat
 ing their interactions that exhibits several notable advantages over previ
 ous techniques. By fully incorporating the dynamics of the solid into pres
 sure projection\, we simultaneously handle fluid incompressibility and sol
 id elasticity and damping. Thanks to this strong coupling\, our method doe
 s not suffer from instability\, even in very taxing scenarios. Furthermore
 \, use of a cut-cell discretization methodology allows us to accurately ap
 ply proper free-slip boundary conditions at the exact solid-fluid interfac
 e. Consequently\, our method is capable of correctly simulating inviscid t
 angential flow\, devoid of grid artefacts or artificial sticking. Lastly\,
  we present an efficient algebraic transformation to convert the indefinit
 e coupled pressure projection system into positive-definite form.  \n \n \

 e\nTitle:   "Scalable and Holistic Qualitative Data Cleaning" \n\nAbstract
 :  Data quality is one of the most important problems in data management\,
  since dirty data often leads to inaccurate data analytics results and wro
 ng business decisions. Poor data across businesses and the government cost
  the U.S. economy $3.1 trillion a year\, according to a report by InsightS
 quared in 2012. Data scientists reportedly spend 60% of their time in clea
 ning and organizing the data according to a survey published in Forbes in 
 2016. Therefore\, we need to design effective and efficient techniques to 
 reduce the human efforts in data cleaning.\n Data cleaning activities usua
 lly consist of two phases: error detection and error repair. Error detecti
 on techniques can generally be classified as either quantitative or qualit
 ative. Quantitative error detection techniques often involve statistical a
 nd machine learning methods to identify abnormal behaviors and errors. Qua
 ntitative error detection techniques have been mostly studied in the conte
 xt of outlier detection. Qualitative error detection techniques rely on de
 scriptive approaches to specify patterns or constraints of a legal data in
 stance. One common way of specifying those patterns or constraints is by u
 sing data quality rules. Qualitative error detection techniques based on d
 ata quality rules capture errors by identifying violations of the specifie
 d rules. This dissertation focuses on tackling the challenges associated w
 ith detecting and repairing qualitative errors.\n To clean a dirty dataset
  using rule-based qualitative data cleaning techniques\, we first need to 
 design data quality rules that reflect the semantics of the data. One way 
 to obtain data quality rules is by consulting domain experts\, which requi
 res a lot of domain expertise and is usually a time-consuming processing. 
 Therefore\, we need automatic techniques to discover data quality rules. W
 e show how to mine data quality rules expressed in the formalism of denial
  constraints (DCs). We choose DCs as the formal language for capturing dat
 a quality rules because it is able to capture many real-life data quality 
 rules\, and at the same time it allows for efficient discovery algorithm\,
  as we will show in this dissertation.\n In detecting qualitative errors\,
  we tackle the scalability challenges associated with it\, as error detect
 ion often requires a tuple pairwise comparison\, a quadratic complexity th
 at is expensive for a large dataset. We present a distribution strategy th
 at distributes the error detection workload evenly to a cluster of machine
 s in a parallel shared-nothing computing environment. Our proposed distrib
 ution strategy aims at minimizing the maximum computation cost and the max
 imum communication cost across all machines\, which are the two main types
  of cost one needs to consider in a shared-nothing environment.\n In repai
 ring qualitative errors\, we propose a holistic data cleaning technique\, 
 which accumulates evidences from a broad spectrum of data quality rules\, 
 and suggests possible data updates in a holistic manner. Compared with pre
 vious piece-meal data repairing approaches\, the holistic approach produce
 s data updates with higher accuracy because it realizes the interactions b
 etween different errors using one representation\, and aims at generating 
 data updates that can fix as many errors as possible.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Areej Alhothali\, David R. Cheriton School of Comput

 o Model Sentiment Dynamics in Event-based Text" \n\nAbstract:  Natural lan
 guage texts are often meant to express or impact individuals emotions. S
 entiment analysis researchers are increasingly interested in investigating
  natural language processing techniques as well as emotions theories to cl
 assify sentiments expressed in natural language text. Most sentiment analy
 sis research effort focuses on classifying highly opinionated documents fr
 om the writer's perspectives and uses either count-based word representati
 ons that ignore sentence structure or a small set of lexicon resources tha
 t do not cover the wide range of words used on the Internet. \n In this th
 esis\, we propose a cross-disciplinary approach that incorporates Affect C
 ontrol Theory (ACT) into a structured model to determine three-dimensional
  sentiment polarity of event-based articles from the readers and interac
 tants perspectives. ACT is a socio-mathematical theory that models human
 s' sentiment towards social events in a three-dimensional space and estima
 tes the situational post-event sentiment by considering the interaction be
 tween these sentiments. \n We develop an algorithm that performs a fine-gr
 ained events extraction from English sentences using a combination of sema
 ntic and syntactic parsing techniques. We also augment an ACT three-dimens
 ional lexicon in a semi-supervised fashion using a graph-based label propa
 gation method built upon semantic and distributed word representations. Us
 ing the extracted events\, the augmented lexicon\, and the ACT mathematica
 l equations\, we propose an entity-based sentiment analysis approach that 
 models the readers triggered emotions from event-based sentences toward 
 the events and their associated entities. We also propose an ACT-based mod
 el to predict the temporal progression of the interactants emotions and 
 their optimal behaviour (acts) over a sequence of interactions. We evaluat
 e the first approach on a manually annotated news headline corpus and the 
 second on three different types of corpora: fairy tales\, news articles\, 
 and a hand-crafted corpus. \n The results demonstrate that\, despite the c
 hallenging structure of the sentences\, there was a reasonable agreement b
 etween the estimated emotions and behaviours and their corresponding groun
 d truths.  \n \n  \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Mustafa Elsheikh\, David R. Cheriton School of Compu
 ter Science\nTitle:   "Smith Normal Form over Local Rings and Related Prob
 lems" \n\nAbstract:  Smith normal form is a diagonalization of matrices wi
 th many applications in diophantine analysis\, graph theory\, system contr
 ol theory\, simplified homology\, and\, more recently\, in topographic dat
 a analysis of big data. Efficient computation of Smith form is a well-stud
 ied area for matrices with integer and polynomial entries. Existing succes
 sful algorithms typically rely on elimination for dense matrices and itera
 tive Krylov space methods for sparse matrices.\n Our interest lies in comp
 uting Smith normal form for sparse matrices over local rings\, where tradi
 tional iterative methods face challenges due to the lack of unique minimal
  polynomials. We explore different approaches to tackling this problem for
  two local rings: integers modulo prime powers\, and polynomials modulo po
 wer of an irreducible element. Over local polynomial rings\, we find succe
 ss in linearization into larger dimension matrices over the base field. Ef
 fectively\, we transform the problem of computing Smith normal form into a
  small number of rank problems over the base field. The latter problem has
  existing efficient algorithms.\n The problem is harder over local integer
  rings. We take the approach of hybrid sparse-dense algorithms. We also ta
 ckle a restricted version of the problem where we detect only the first no
 n-trivial invariant factor. We also give an algorithm to find the first fe
 w invariant factors using iterative rank-1 updates. This method becomes de
 nse when applied to finding all the invariant factors.\n We digress slight
 ly into the related problem of preconditioning. We show that linearization
  preconditions are suitable for computing Smith normal form\, and computin
 g nullspace samples. For the latter problem\, we design an algorithm for c
 omputing uniform samples from the nullspace.\n On a separate track\, we fo
 cus on the properties of the Smith normal form decomposition. We relate th
 e invariant factors to eigenvalues. Our ultimate goal is to extend the app
 lications of numerical algorithms for computing eigenvalues to computing t
 he invariant factors of symbolic matrices.  \n \n   \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Cătălin-Alexandru Avram\, David R. Cheriton School
  of Computer Science\nTitle:   "Geographically Distributed Database Manage
 ment at the Cloud's Edge" \n\nAbstract:  Request latency resulting from th
 e geographic separation between clients and remote application servers is 
 a challenge for cloud-hosted web and mobile applications. Numerous studies
  have shown the importance of low latency to the end user experience. Smal
 l response time increases on the order of a few hundred milliseconds direc
 tly translate to reduced user satisfaction and loss of revenue that persis
 t even after a low latency environment is restored. One way to address thi
 s challenge in geo-distributed settings is to push all or part of the appl
 ication\, along with the data it requires\, to the edge of the cloud  cl
 oser to application clients. My thesis explores the idea of taking advanta
 ge of clients' proximity to the edge of the network in order to reduce req
 uest latencies.\n SpearDB is a prototype replicated distributed database s
 ystem that operates in a star network topology\, with a core site and a la
 rge number of edge sites that are close to clients. Clients access the nea
 rest edge\, which holds replicas of locally relevant portions of the datab
 ase. SpearDB's edge sites coordinate through the core to provide a global 
 transactional consistency guarantee (parallel snapshot isolation or PSI)\,
  while handling as much work locally as possible. SpearDB provides full ge
 neral purpose transactional semantics with ACID guarantees. Experiments sh
 ow that SpearDB is effective at reducing workload latencies for applicatio
 ns whose access patterns are geographically localizable. Many applications
  fit this criteria: bulletin boards (e.g.\, Craigslist\, Kijiji)\, local c
 ommerce or services (e.g.\, Groupon\, Uber)\, booking and ticketing (e.g.\
 , OpenTable\, StubHub)\, location-based services (mapping\, directions\, a
 ugmented reality)\, local news outlets and client-centric services (e-mail
 \, rss feeds\, gaming). SpearDB introduces protocols for executing applica
 tion transactions in a geo-distributed setting under strong consistency gu
 arantees. These protocols automatically hide the complexity as well as muc
 h of the latency introduced by geo-distribution from applications.\n The e
 ffectiveness of SpearDB depends on the placement of primary and secondary 
 replicas at core and edge sites. The secondary replica placement problem i
 s shown to be NP-hard. Several algorithms for automatic data partitioning 
 and replication are presented to provide approximate solutions. These algo
 rithms work in a geo-distributed core-edge setting under partial replicati
 on. Their goal is to bring data closer to clients in order to lower reques
 t latencies. Experimental comparisons of the resulting placements' latency
  impact show good results. Surprisingly\, however\, the placements produce
 d by the simplest of the proposed algorithms are comparable in quality to 
 those produced by more complex approaches.  \n \n
