 ame\nDiane Watson\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science\n\nTextbo
 oks\, as supplementary material\, are known to improve student outcomes by
  accommodating multiple learning types and reinforcing material learned in
  class\; however\, most students do not often complete assigned readings. 
 We created Reading Garden\, a motivational game aimed to get students to r
 ead more of the textbook. Reading Garden is a casual\, multiplayer game fo
 llowing common design patterns of many social games. For example\, it foll
 ows the free-to-play model\, where the game can always be played for free\
 , but has special advanced actions and decorations that can be purchased w
 ith gold  a special in-game currency. Players earn gold by completing as
 signed readings.

DESCRIPTION:ALGORAND\, A New Public Ledger\nSilvio Micali\, MIT\n\nA publi
 c ledger is a tamperproof sequence of data that can be read and augmented 
 by everyone. Shared public ledgers stand to revolutionize the way a democr
 atic society operates. They secure all kinds of traditional transactions 
  such as payments\, asset transfers\, titling  in the exact order in w
 hich they occur\, and enable totally new transactions  such as cryptocur
 rencies and smart contracts. They can remove intermediaries and usher in a
  new paradigm for trust. As currently implemented\, however\, public ledge
 rs cannot achieve their enormous potential.

 suming widely-conjectured worst-case hardness of certain problems from the
  study of fine-grained complexity.

DESCRIPTION:A Biologically Constrained Model of Semantic Memory Search\nIv
 ana Kajić\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science\n\nThe semantic 
 fluency task has been used to understand the effects of semantic relations
 hips on human memory search. A variety of computational models have been p
 roposed that explain human behavioral data\, yet it remains unclear how mi
 llions of spiking neurons work in unison to realize the cognitive processe
 s involved in memory search.
