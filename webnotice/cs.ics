DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Ivana Kajić\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer 
 Science\nTitle:   "A Biologically Constrained Model of Semantic Memory Sea
 rch" \n\nAbstract:  The semantic fluency task has been used to understand 
 the effects of semantic relationships on human memory search. A variety of
  computational models have been proposed that explain human behavioral dat
 a\, yet it remains unclear how millions of spiking neurons work in unison 
 to realize the cognitive processes involved in memory search. \n In this t
 alk\, I will present a biologically constrained neural network model that 
 performs the task in a fashion similar to humans. The model reproduces exp
 erimentally observed response timing effects\, as well as similarity trend
 s within and across semantic categories derived from responses. Three diff
 erent sources of the association data have been tested by embedding associ
 ations in neural connections\, with free association norms providing the b
 est match.  \n \n    \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Olga Veksler\, Computer Science Department\, Western
  University\nTitle:   "Efficient Discrete Optimization for Binary Energies
  with Applications to Image Segmentation" \n\nRemarks:  Please note: This 
 is a SACA seminar.  \n\nAbstract:  Discrete optimization is a successful a
 pproach for numerous computer vision applications. The state of the art in
  several fundamental vision tasks  such as stereo correspondence\, image
  segmentation\, image stitching\, etc.  has been moved forward significa
 ntly due to the development of effective energy minimization techniques. A
  particularly useful class of energies comes from Markov Random Field (MRF
 ) or Conditional Random Field (CRF) models. Even with the recent revolutio
 n in the field due to deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\, CRF and 
 MRF models are still highly relevant. CNNs\, although excellent at learnin
 g image features\, do not model pixel dependencies and can produce results
  with noisy isolated regions. MRF/CRF models\, on the other hand\,  are ex
 cellent at obtaining  spatially coherent results. Therefore many CNN  mode
 ls whose goal is pixel-precise image labeling use CRFs for refining the ac
 curacy.\n The major difficulty of energy minimization framework is its hig
 h computational cost\, as many energies arising in practice are NP-hard to
  minimize. In this talk\, I will present several efficient methods for min
 imization of binary energies. Binary energies are an essential class to ha
 ndle\, as optimization of general energies can be reduced to the binary ca
 se. We have developed efficient algorithms for binary nonsubmodular energi
 es that are based on two different frameworks: Trust Region (TR) and Auxil
 iary Functions (AUX). The methods that we have developed significantly out
 perform the previously known state of the art on many applications. For ap
 plications such as image segmentation with convex shape prior and with cur
 vature regularization\, previously available methods fail completely\, whi
 le our methods achieve accurate results. \n      \n Bio : Ol

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Erik Waingarten\, Columbia University\nTitle:   "Set
 tling the Query Complexity of Non-adaptive Junta Testing" \n\nAbstract:  I
 n this talk\, I will show that any non-adaptive algorithm that tests wheth
 er an unknown Boolean function f:{0\,1}^n→{0\,1} is a k-junta or ϵ-far 
 from every k-junta must make Ω(k^(3/2)/ϵ) many queries. This result is
  essentially optimal given Blais's non-adaptive junta tester\, which makes
  O(k^(3/2))/ϵ queries and shows that adaptivity enables polynomial savi
 ngs in query complexity for junta testing. At a very high level\, the proo
 f proceeds by reducing the non-adaptive junta testing of a new class of ra
 ndom Boolean functions to a problem of distinguishing two binomial distrib
 utions with a specific kind of noisy query. \n This is joint work with Xi

 e\nTitle:   "Scalable and Holistic Qualitative Data Cleaning" \n\nAbstract
 :  Data quality is one of the most important problems in data management\,
  since dirty data often leads to inaccurate data analytics results and wro
 ng business decisions. Poor data across businesses and the government cost
  the U.S. economy $3.1 trillion a year\, according to a report by InsightS
 quared in 2012. Data scientists reportedly spend 60% of their time in clea
 ning and organizing the data according to a survey published in Forbes in 
 2016. Therefore\, we need to design effective and efficient techniques to 
 reduce the human efforts in data cleaning.\n Data cleaning activities usua
 lly consist of two phases: error detection and error repair. Error detecti
 on techniques can generally be classified as either quantitative or qualit
 ative. Quantitative error detection techniques often involve statistical a
 nd machine learning methods to identify abnormal behaviors and errors. Qua
 ntitative error detection techniques have been mostly studied in the conte
 xt of outlier detection. Qualitative error detection techniques rely on de
 scriptive approaches to specify patterns or constraints of a legal data in
 stance. One common way of specifying those patterns or constraints is by u
 sing data quality rules. Qualitative error detection techniques based on d
 ata quality rules capture errors by identifying violations of the specifie
 d rules. This dissertation focuses on tackling the challenges associated w
 ith detecting and repairing qualitative errors.\n To clean a dirty dataset
  using rule-based qualitative data cleaning techniques\, we first need to 
 design data quality rules that reflect the semantics of the data. One way 
 to obtain data quality rules is by consulting domain experts\, which requi
 res a lot of domain expertise and is usually a time-consuming processing. 
 Therefore\, we need automatic techniques to discover data quality rules. W
 e show how to mine data quality rules expressed in the formalism of denial
  constraints (DCs). We choose DCs as the formal language for capturing dat
 a quality rules because it is able to capture many real-life data quality 
 rules\, and at the same time it allows for efficient discovery algorithm\,
  as we will show in this dissertation.\n In detecting qualitative errors\,
  we tackle the scalability challenges associated with it\, as error detect
 ion often requires a tuple pairwise comparison\, a quadratic complexity th
 at is expensive for a large dataset. We present a distribution strategy th
 at distributes the error detection workload evenly to a cluster of machine
 s in a parallel shared-nothing computing environment. Our proposed distrib
 ution strategy aims at minimizing the maximum computation cost and the max
 imum communication cost across all machines\, which are the two main types
  of cost one needs to consider in a shared-nothing environment.\n In repai
 ring qualitative errors\, we propose a holistic data cleaning technique\, 
 which accumulates evidences from a broad spectrum of data quality rules\, 
 and suggests possible data updates in a holistic manner. Compared with pre
 vious piece-meal data repairing approaches\, the holistic approach produce
 s data updates with higher accuracy because it realizes the interactions b
 etween different errors using one representation\, and aims at generating 
 data updates that can fix as many errors as possible.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Areej Alhothali\, David R. Cheriton School of Comput
 er Science\nTitle:   "A Socio-mathematical and Structured-based Approach t
 o Model Sentiment Dynamics in Event-based Text" \n\nAbstract:  Natural lan
 guage texts are often meant to express or impact individuals emotions. S
 entiment analysis researchers are increasingly interested in investigating
  natural language processing techniques as well as emotions theories to cl
 assify sentiments expressed in natural language text. Most sentiment analy
 sis research effort focuses on classifying highly opinionated documents fr
 om the writer's perspectives and uses either count-based word representati
 ons that ignore sentence structure or a small set of lexicon resources tha
 t do not cover the wide range of words used on the Internet. \n In this th
 esis\, we propose a cross-disciplinary approach that incorporates Affect C
 ontrol Theory (ACT) into a structured model to determine three-dimensional
  sentiment polarity of event-based articles from the readers and interac
 tants perspectives. ACT is a socio-mathematical theory that models human
 s' sentiment towards social events in a three-dimensional space and estima
 tes the situational post-event sentiment by considering the interaction be
 tween these sentiments. \n We develop an algorithm that performs a fine-gr
 ained events extraction from English sentences using a combination of sema
 ntic and syntactic parsing techniques. We also augment an ACT three-dimens
 ional lexicon in a semi-supervised fashion using a graph-based label propa
 gation method built upon semantic and distributed word representations. Us
 ing the extracted events\, the augmented lexicon\, and the ACT mathematica
 l equations\, we propose an entity-based sentiment analysis approach that 
 models the readers triggered emotions from event-based sentences toward 
 the events and their associated entities. We also propose an ACT-based mod
 el to predict the temporal progression of the interactants emotions and 
 their optimal behaviour (acts) over a sequence of interactions. We evaluat
 e the first approach on a manually annotated news headline corpus and the 
 second on three different types of corpora: fairy tales\, news articles\, 
 and a hand-crafted corpus. \n The results demonstrate that\, despite the c
 hallenging structure of the sentences\, there was a reasonable agreement b
 etween the estimated emotions and behaviours and their corresponding groun
 d truths.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Mustafa Elsheikh\, David R. Cheriton School of Compu
 ter Science\nTitle:   "Smith Normal Form over Local Rings and Related Prob
 lems" \n\nAbstract:  Smith normal form is a diagonalization of matrices wi
 th many applications in diophantine analysis\, graph theory\, system contr
 ol theory\, simplified homology\, and\, more recently\, in topographic dat
 a analysis of big data. Efficient computation of Smith form is a well-stud
 ied area for matrices with integer and polynomial entries. Existing succes
 sful algorithms typically rely on elimination for dense matrices and itera
 tive Krylov space methods for sparse matrices.\n Our interest lies in comp
 uting Smith normal form for sparse matrices over local rings\, where tradi
 tional iterative methods face challenges due to the lack of unique minimal
  polynomials. We explore different approaches to tackling this problem for
  two local rings: integers modulo prime powers\, and polynomials modulo po
 wer of an irreducible element. Over local polynomial rings\, we find succe
 ss in linearization into larger dimension matrices over the base field. Ef
 fectively\, we transform the problem of computing Smith normal form into a
  small number of rank problems over the base field. The latter problem has
  existing efficient algorithms.\n The problem is harder over local integer
  rings. We take the approach of hybrid sparse-dense algorithms. We also ta
 ckle a restricted version of the problem where we detect only the first no
 n-trivial invariant factor. We also give an algorithm to find the first fe
 w invariant factors using iterative rank-1 updates. This method becomes de
 nse when applied to finding all the invariant factors.\n We digress slight
 ly into the related problem of preconditioning. We show that linearization
  preconditions are suitable for computing Smith normal form\, and computin
 g nullspace samples. For the latter problem\, we design an algorithm for c
 omputing uniform samples from the nullspace.\n On a separate track\, we fo
 cus on the properties of the Smith normal form decomposition. We relate th
 e invariant factors to eigenvalues. Our ultimate goal is to extend the app
 lications of numerical algorithms for computing eigenvalues to computing t
 he invariant factors of symbolic matrices.  \n \n
