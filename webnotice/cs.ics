DESCRIPTION:Contact Representation of Planar Graphs in 2D and 3D\nStephen 
 Kobourov\, Department of Computer Science\, University of Arizona\n\nIn a 
 proportional contact representation of a planar graph\, each vertex is rep
 resented by a simple polygon with area proportional to a given weight\, an
 d edges are represented by adjacencies between the corresponding pairs of 
 polygons. We show how to use Schnyder realizers and canonical orders for p
 lanar graphs to obtain different types of contact representations. Specifi
 cally\, we describe an algorithm that constructs proportional contact repr
 esentation for arbitrary planar graphs using 10-sided rectilinear polygons
 . We also describe a construction with 8-sided polygons\, which is optimal
  in terms of polygonal complexity\, as 8-sided polygons are sometimes nece
 ssary. In 3D vertices are represented by polytopes and edges by contacts b
 etween the corresponding polytopes contacts. We show that planar 3-trees h
 ave contact representations with cubes and proportional contact representa
 tions with boxes.

DESCRIPTION:DBMS as a Bioinformatics Application Platform\nEvguenia Eflov\
 , David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science\n\nWith recent advancements
  in technology\, bioinformatics applications have to process and manage co
 nstantly growing amounts of data. Applications developed for a single proc
 essing node may not be sufficient to handle the demands of the current dat
 a volume. Several processing frameworks that aim to overcome the limitatio
 ns of a single computer have been proposed and used\, with MapReduce\, MPI
  and GPU-based being the most utilized. Of the three\, MapReduce is most f
 requently used in practice\; however\, there are limitations to usefulness
  of the framework\, most notably\, the required structure of the applicati
 on tasks executed in the framework.

 sity of Campinas\n\nThe genome median problem is an important problem in p
 hylogenetic reconstruction under rearrangement models. It can be stated as
  follows: Given three genomes\, find a fourth that minimizes the sum of th
 e pairwise rearrangement distances between it and the three input genomes.

 oks\, as supplementary material\, are known to improve student outcomes by
  accommodating multiple learning types and reinforcing material learned in
  class\; however\, most students do not often complete assigned readings. 
 We created Reading Garden\, a motivational game aimed to get students to r
 ead more of the textbook. Reading Garden is a casual\, multiplayer game fo
 llowing common design patterns of many social games. For example\, it foll
 ows the free-to-play model\, where the game can always be played for free\
 , but has special advanced actions and decorations that can be purchased w
 ith gold  a special in-game currency. Players earn gold by completing as
 signed readings.

DESCRIPTION:ALGORAND\, A New Public Ledger\nSilvio Micali\, MIT\n\nA publi
 c ledger is a tamperproof sequence of data that can be read and augmented 
 by everyone. Shared public ledgers stand to revolutionize the way a democr
 atic society operates. They secure all kinds of traditional transactions 
  such as payments\, asset transfers\, titling  in the exact order in w
 hich they occur\, and enable totally new transactions  such as cryptocur
 rencies and smart contracts. They can remove intermediaries and usher in a
  new paradigm for trust. As currently implemented\, however\, public ledge
 rs cannot achieve their enormous potential.

 ana Kajić\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science\n\nThe semantic 
 fluency task has been used to understand the effects of semantic relations
 hips on human memory search. A variety of computational models have been p
 roposed that explain human behavioral data\, yet it remains unclear how mi
 llions of spiking neurons work in unison to realize the cognitive processe
 s involved in memory search.
