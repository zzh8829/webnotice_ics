DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Diane Watson\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer 
 Science\nTitle:   "Reading Garden: A Case Study of an In-Classroom Motivat
 ional Game" \n\nAbstract:  Textbooks\, as supplementary material\, are kno
 wn to improve student outcomes by accommodating multiple learning types an
 d reinforcing material learned in class\; however\, most students do not o
 ften complete assigned readings. We created Reading Garden\, a motivationa
 l game aimed to get students to read more of the textbook. Reading Garden 
 is a casual\, multiplayer game following common design patterns of many so
 cial games. For example\, it follows the free-to-play model\, where the ga
 me can always be played for free\, but has special advanced actions and de
 corations that can be purchased with gold  a special in-game currency. P
 layers earn gold by completing assigned readings.\n We then deployed Readi
 ng Garden in three iterations of a human computer interaction courses\, in
  two different departments\, at the University of Waterloo. Each study fea
 tured an entire class playing the game simultaneously throughout the four-
 month term. This talk will discuss the results of those ecologically valid
  deployments\, as well as the ethical challenges associated with conductin
 g studies in classrooms.  \n \n      \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Milad Khaki\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer S
 cience\nTitle:   "Bidder Profiling by Acquisition and Analysis of Market D
 ata in Water Distribution Industry" \n\nAbstract:  The project involves th
 e analysis of procurement auctions for water infrastructure maintenance pr
 ojects for Cities of Niagara Falls and London. The primary concern of this
  proposal is to generate a reliable mechanism for importing different form
 ats of the tender summaries\, provided as input data\, of the projects and
  unify them in a database for further exploration and processing. For this
  part of the research\, I developed a water infrastructure ontology to sta
 ndardize the different aspects of the knowledge available in this field\, 
 which would eventually help us to import the data and look for any context
 ual inconsistencies and errors and act appropriately to repair them.\n The
  next part of the project\, the primary focus the study\, is to analyze th
 e historical auction data to extract various valuable pieces of informatio
 n from them such as inflation rate and unit project prices. Also\, it is p
 ossible to look into generating a profile of each recurrent bidder (contra
 ctor) and establish the statistical likelihood model of their behaviour. T
 herefore\, any future auction can be inspected and compared to these profi
 les and any discrepancies or unexpected or highly unlikely behaviour that 
 would raise a red flag can be found for further investigation. A comprehen
 sive list of features that can act as the indicators of bidder behaviour i
 s presented in this proposal\, as well. The preliminary goal is to minimiz
 e the probability of any possible collusion (or find them if any exists) a
 nd detect unusual behaviours that might exist in the procurement auctions.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Silvio Micali\, MIT\nTitle:   "ALGORAND\, A New Publ
 ic Ledger" \n\nAbstract:  A public ledger is a tamperproof sequence of dat
 a that can be read and augmented by everyone. Shared public ledgers stand 
 to revolutionize the way a democratic society operates. They secure all ki
 nds of traditional transactions  such as payments\, asset transfers\, ti
 tling  in the exact order in which they occur\, and enable totally new t
 ransactions  such as cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. They can remo
 ve intermediaries and usher in a new paradigm for trust. As currently impl
 emented\, however\, public ledgers cannot achieve their enormous potential
 .\n Algorand is a quite alternative\, truly democratic\, and very efficien
 t way to implement a public ledger. Unlike prior implementations based on 
 proof of work\, it requires a negligible amount of computation\, and gener
 ates a transaction history that will not fork with overwhelmingly high
  probability. \n      \n Dr. Silvio Micali has received his 
 Laurea in Mathematics from the University of Rome\, and his PhD in Compute
 r Science from the University of California at Berkeley. Since 1983 he has
  been on the MIT faculty.\n Silvios research interests are cryptography\
 , zero knowledge\, pseudo-random generation\, secure protocols\, mechanism
  design\, and distributed ledgers. \n Silvio has received the Turing Award

 ademy of Sciences\, the National Academy of Engineering\, and the American

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Prashant Nalini Vasudevan\, MIT\nTitle:   "Average-C
 ase Fine-Grained Hardness\, And What To Do With It" \n\nAbstract:  We pres
 ent functions that are hard to compute on average for algorithms running i
 n some fixed polynomial time\, assuming widely-conjectured worst-case hard
 ness of certain problems from the study of fine-grained complexity.\n We d
 iscuss the relevance of such average-case hardness to cryptography and pre
 sent\, as an illustration\, an outline of a proof-of-work protocol constru
 cted based on the hardness and certain structural properties of our functi
 ons. \n This work is joint with Marshall Ball\, Alon Rosen and Manuel Sabi
 n.\n      \n Bio : Prashant Nalini Vasudevan is a student at
  MIT\, advised by Vinod Vaikuntanathan. He is interested broadly in comple
 xity theory and cryptography\, and narrowly in the understanding the funda
 mentals of complexity-based cryptography\, which involves questions like w
 hat sorts of functions are useful when they are hard and what generic assu
 mptions are necessary or sufficient to construct various cryptographic obj
 ects  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Ivana Kajić\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer 
 Science\nTitle:   "A Biologically Constrained Model of Semantic Memory Sea
 rch" \n\nAbstract:  The semantic fluency task has been used to understand 
 the effects of semantic relationships on human memory search. A variety of
  computational models have been proposed that explain human behavioral dat
 a\, yet it remains unclear how millions of spiking neurons work in unison 
 to realize the cognitive processes involved in memory search. \n In this t
 alk\, I will present a biologically constrained neural network model that 
 performs the task in a fashion similar to humans. The model reproduces exp
 erimentally observed response timing effects\, as well as similarity trend
 s within and across semantic categories derived from responses. Three diff
 erent sources of the association data have been tested by embedding associ
 ations in neural connections\, with free association norms providing the b
 est match.  \n \n
