DESCRIPTION:Reading Garden: A Case Study of an In-Classroom Motivational G
 ame\nDiane Watson\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science\nHuman-Co
 mputer Interaction PhD Seminar\n\n\nTextbooks\, as supplementary material\
 , are known to improve student outcomes by accommodating multiple learning
  types and reinforcing material learned in class\; however\, most students
  do not often complete assigned readings. We created Reading Garden\, a mo
 tivational game aimed to get students to read more of the textbook. Readin
 g Garden is a casual\, multiplayer game following common design patterns o
 f many social games. For example\, it follows the free-to-play model\, whe
 re the game can always be played for free\, but has special advanced actio
 ns and decorations that can be purchased with gold  a special in-game cu
 rrency. Players earn gold by completing assigned readings.

DESCRIPTION:Bidder Profiling by Acquisition and Analysis of Market Data in
  Water Distribution Industry\nMilad Khaki\, David R. Cheriton School of Co
 mputer Science\nArtificial Intelligence Lab PhD Seminar\n\n\nThe project i
 nvolves the analysis of procurement auctions for water infrastructure main
 tenance projects for Cities of Niagara Falls and London. The primary conce
 rn of this proposal is to generate a reliable mechanism for importing diff
 erent formats of the tender summaries\, provided as input data\, of the pr
 ojects and unify them in a database for further exploration and processing
 . For this part of the research\, I developed a water infrastructure ontol
 ogy to standardize the different aspects of the knowledge available in thi
 s field\, which would eventually help us to import the data and look for a
 ny contextual inconsistencies and errors and act appropriately to repair t
 hem.

DESCRIPTION:ALGORAND\, A New Public Ledger\nSilvio Micali\, MIT\nDistingui
 shed Lecture Series Seminar\n\n\nA public ledger is a tamperproof sequence
  of data that can be read and augmented by everyone. Shared public ledgers
  stand to revolutionize the way a democratic society operates. They secure
  all kinds of traditional transactions  such as payments\, asset transfe
 rs\, titling  in the exact order in which they occur\, and enable totall
 y new transactions  such as cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. They c
 an remove intermediaries and usher in a new paradigm for trust. As current
 ly implemented\, however\, public ledgers cannot achieve their enormous po
 tential.

 ly-conjectured worst-case hardness of certain problems from the study of f
 ine-grained complexity.

 ana Kajić\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science\nArtificial Inte
 lligence Lab PhD Seminar\n\n\nThe semantic fluency task has been used to u
 nderstand the effects of semantic relationships on human memory search. A 
 variety of computational models have been proposed that explain human beha
 vioral data\, yet it remains unclear how millions of spiking neurons work 
 in unison to realize the cognitive processes involved in memory search.
