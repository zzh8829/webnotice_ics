DESCRIPTION:Artin's conjecture on primitive roots and function field analo
 gues\nDavid Tweedle\, The University of the West Indies\n\nRecall Artin's 
 primitive root conjecture\, which states that if\n\\(a\\) is not \\(-1\\) 
 or a square then the reduction of \\(a\\) modulo \\(p\\)\ngenerates the mu
 ltiplicative group of the integers modulo \\(p\\) for\ninfinitely many pri
 mes \\(p\\).  We will examine the similarities and\ndifferences between Ar
 tin's conjecture and some natural analogues for\nelliptic curves and funct
 ion fields.

 f Konstanz\n\nLet (M\, P) be an expansion of an o-minimal structure M by a
 \ndense subset P of M\, such that three tameness conditions hold. We prove
 \nthat the induced structure on P by M eliminates imaginaries. As a\ncorol
 lary\, we obtain that every small set X definable in M can be\ndefinably e
 mbedded into some P^n\, uniformly in parameters. We then verify\nthe tamen
 ess conditions in three examples: dense pairs\, expansions of M by\na dens
 e independent set\, and expansions by a dense divisible\nmultiplicative gr
 oup with the Mann property.

 dering number of adjectives that might be attached to a scheme\, some of w
 hich are topological in nature\, some of which are algebraic in nature\, a
 nd some of which refer to all the structural properties of the scheme at o
 nce.  To get our bearings\, we will start by recalling all the important a
 djectives discussed so far and categorize them.  Then\, we move to the top
 ic of associated points\, first looking at them in the context of finitely
  generated modules over a Noetherian ring.  Time permitting\, we will disc
 uss associated points of locally Noetherian schemes as well and see how th
 ey can be used to define rational functions on such schemes.

 cCormick\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\n\nWhat
  is Newton really saying when he writes $F=ma$? We know the $a$ stands for
  acceleration but the acceleration of what? The $F$ is supposed to be the 
 total force acting on the system but what precisely is meant by "force"? W
 hat is a "mechanical system"? What does Newton mean by an "inertial refere
 nce frame"? What is space? Time? I'll attempt to answer these questions in
  a way satisfactory for mathematicians. Furthermore\, if time permits\, I'
 ll try to explain some of the ideas behind modern physics and how mathemat
 icians can extract mathematically relevant ideas from physics talks.

  David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science\n\nThe Dependent Object Type
 s (DOT) calculus aims to model the essence of Scala\, with a focus on abst
 ract type members\, path-dependent types\, and subtyping. Other Scala feat
 ures could be defined by translation to DOT. Mutation is a fundamental fea
 ture of Scala currently missing in DOT. Mutation in DOT is needed not only
  to model effectful computation and mutation in Scala programs\, but even 
 to precisely specify how Scala initializes immutable variables and fields 
 (vals).

 Project\nChristian Gorenflo\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science
 \n\nField studies comprising sensor networks pose a multitude of challenge
 s. Robust hardware needs to endure outdoor environments and should change 
 as little as possible during the run of the study because of difficult mai
 ntenance and upgradability. Vast amounts of data generated by the sensor n
 etwork need to be transferred and preprocessed for easier analysis on a hi
 gh-performance system. Depending on the type of data an adequate data mana
 gement platform must be chosen. Lastly\, the software on the edge of the n
 etwork must be updateable over the air to combat data quality issues and e
 xtending sensing capabilities.

 Lyons\, Oxford University\n\nRough path theory aims to build an effective

  of analysis blended with algebra that goes back to LC Young\, and to KT C
 hen. Key to the theory is the essential need to incorporate additional non

DESCRIPTION:Risk Measures in a Quantile Regression Credibility Framework\n
 Georgios Pitselis\, University of Piraeus\n\nRefreshments will be provided
 .\nHere\, we extend the idea of embedding the classical credibility model 
 into risk measures\, as was presented by Pitselis (2016)\, to the idea of 
 embedding regression credibility into risk measures. The resulting credibl
 e regression risk measures capture the risk of individual insurer's contra
 ct (in finance\, the individual asset return portfolio) as well as the por
 tfolio risk consisting of several similar but not identical contracts (in 
 finance\, several similar portfolios of asset returns)\,  which are groupe
 d together to share the risk. In insurance\, credibility plays a special r
 ole of spreading the risk. In financial terminology\, credibility plays a 
 special role of diversification of risk. For each model\, regression credi
 bility models are established  and  the robustness of these models is inve
 stigated. Applications to Fama/French financial portfolio data are also pr
 esented.

 rik Waingarten\, Columbia University\n\nIn this talk\, I will show that an
 y non-adaptive algorithm that tests whether an unknown Boolean function f:
 {0\,1}^n→{0\,1} is a k-junta or ϵ-far from every k-junta must make Ω
 (k^(3/2)/ϵ) many queries. This result is essentially optimal given Blais'
 s non-adaptive junta tester\, which makes O(k^(3/2))/ϵ queries and show
 s that adaptivity enables polynomial savings in query complexity for junta
  testing. At a very high level\, the proof proceeds by reducing the non-ad
 aptive junta testing of a new class of random Boolean functions to a probl
 em of distinguishing two binomial distributions with a specific kind of no
 isy query.
