 itle:   "Artin's conjecture on primitive roots and function field analogue
 s" \n\nAbstract:  Recall Artin's primitive root conjecture\, which states 
 that if\n\\(a\\) is not \\(-1\\) or a square then the reduction of \\(a\\)
  modulo \\(p\\)\ngenerates the multiplicative group of the integers modulo
  \\(p\\) for\ninfinitely many primes \\(p\\).  We will examine the similar
 ities and\ndifferences between Artin's conjecture and some natural analogu
 es for\nelliptic curves and function fields.  \n \n \n

 efinable in M can be\ndefinably embedded into some P^n\, uniformly in para
 meters. We then verify\nthe tameness conditions in three examples: dense p
 airs\, expansions of M by\na dense independent set\, and expansions by a d

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Blake Madill\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, Univ
 ersity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Contributions to the Theory of Radicals for 
 Noncommutative Rings" \n\nAbstract:  We consider several radical classes o
 f noncommutative rings. In particular\, we provide new results regarding t
 he radical theory of semigroup-graded rings\, monomial algebras\, and Ore 
 extensions of derivation type. \n In Chapter 2 it is shown that every ring
  graded by a torsion free nilpotent group has a homogeneous upper nilradic
 al. Moreover\, we show that a ring graded by unique-product semigroup will
  be semiprime only when it has no nonzero nilpotent homogeneous ideals. Th
 is provides a graded-analogue of the classical result that says a ring is 
 semiprime if and only if it has no nonzero nilpotent ideals. \n In Chapter
  3\, the class of iterative algebras are introduced. Iterative algebras se
 rve as an interesting class of monomial algebras where ring theoretical in
 formation may be determined from combinatorial information of an associate
 d right-infinite word. We use these monomial algebras to construct an exam
 ple of a prime\, semiprimitive\, graded-nilpotent algebra of Gelfand-Kiril
 lov dimension 2 which is finitely generated as a Lie algebra. \n In Chapte
 r 4\, the Jacobson radical of Ore extensions of derivation type is discuss
 ed. We show that if $R$ is a locally nilpotent ring which satisfies a poly
 nomial identity then any Ore extension of $R$ of derivation type will also
  be locally nilpotent. Finally\, we show that the Jacobson radical of any 
 Ore extension of derivation type of a polynomial identity ring will have a
  nil coefficient ring.  \n \n \n

 t:  By now\, we have seen a bewildering number of adjectives that might be
  attached to a scheme\, some of which are topological in nature\, some of 
 which are algebraic in nature\, and some of which refer to all the structu
 ral properties of the scheme at once.  To get our bearings\, we will start
  by recalling all the important adjectives discussed so far and categorize
  them.  Then\, we move to the topic of associated points\, first looking a
 t them in the context of finitely generated modules over a Noetherian ring
 .  Time permitting\, we will discuss associated points of locally Noetheri
 an schemes as well and see how they can be used to define rational functio
 ns on such schemes.  \n \n \n

 tract:  The Dependent Object Types (DOT) calculus aims to model the essenc
 e of Scala\, with a focus on abstract type members\, path-dependent types\
 , and subtyping. Other Scala features could be defined by translation to D
 OT. Mutation is a fundamental feature of Scala currently missing in DOT. M
 utation in DOT is needed not only to model effectful computation and mutat
 ion in Scala programs\, but even to precisely specify how Scala initialize
 s immutable variables and fields (vals). \n We present an extension to DOT
  that adds typed mutable reference cells. We have proven the extension sou
 nd with a mechanized proof in Coq. We present the key features of our exte
 nded calculus and its soundness proof\, and discuss the challenges that we
  encountered in our search for a sound design and the alternative solution
 s that we considered.  \n \n \n

 puter Science\nTitle:   "Managing Sensor Data Streams: Lessons Learned fro
 m the WeBike Project" \n\nAbstract:  Field studies comprising sensor netwo
 rks pose a multitude of challenges. Robust hardware needs to endure outdoo
 r environments and should change as little as possible during the run of t
 he study because of difficult maintenance and upgradability. Vast amounts 
 of data generated by the sensor network need to be transferred and preproc
 essed for easier analysis on a high-performance system. Depending on the t
 ype of data an adequate data management platform must be chosen. Lastly\, 
 the software on the edge of the network must be updateable over the air to
  combat data quality issues and extending sensing capabilities. \n This ta
 lk uses the experience from the WeBike project\, a multi-year study at the
  University of Waterloo that includes 31 sensor-equipped electric bikes\, 
 to propose a general framework for similar sensor network studies and pres
 ents specific lessons learned during the run of the project.  \n \n \n

 ic Ledger" \n\nAbstract:  A public ledger is a tamperproof sequence of dat
 a that can be read and augmented by everyone. Shared public ledgers stand 
 to revolutionize the way a democratic society operates. They secure all ki
 nds of traditional transactions  such as payments\, asset transfers\, ti
 tling  in the exact order in which they occur\, and enable totally new t
 ransactions  such as cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. They can remo
 ve intermediaries and usher in a new paradigm for trust. As currently impl
 emented\, however\, public ledgers cannot achieve their enormous potential
 .\n Algorand is a quite alternative\, truly democratic\, and very efficien
 t way to implement a public ledger. Unlike prior implementations based on 
 proof of work\, it requires a negligible amount of computation\, and gener
 ates a transaction history that will not fork with overwhelmingly high
  probability. \n      \n Dr. Silvio Micali has received his

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Terry Lyons\, Oxford University\nTitle:   "From Hopf
  Algebras to Machine learning via Rough Paths" \n\nAbstract:  Rough path t
 heory aims to build an effective calculus that can model the interactions 
 between complex oscillatory (rough) evolving systems. At its mathematical 
 foundations\, it is a combination of analysis blended with algebra that go
 es back to LC Young\, and to KT Chen. Key to the theory is the essential n
 eed to incorporate additional non-commutative structure into areas of math
 ematics we thought were stable. At its high points\, there are the regular
 ity structures of Martin Hairer that allow robust meaning to be given to n
 umerous core nonlinear stochastic pdes describing evolving interfaces in p
 hysics.\n Classic results\, by Clark\, Cameron and Dickinson\, demonstrate
  that a nonlinear approach to the data is essential.  Rough path theory li
 ves up to this challenge and can be viewed as providing fundamentally more
  efficient ways of approximately describing complex data\; approaches that
 \, after penetrating the basic ideas\, are computationally tractable and l
 ead to new scalable ways to regress\, classify\, and learn functional rela
 tionships from data. One non-mathematical application that is already stri
 king is the use of signatures on a daily basis in the online recognition o

 a of embedding the classical credibility model into risk measures\, as was
  presented by Pitselis (2016)\, to the idea of embedding regression credib
 ility into risk measures. The resulting credible regression risk measures 
 capture the risk of individual insurer's contract (in finance\, the indivi
 dual asset return portfolio) as well as the portfolio risk consisting of s
 everal similar but not identical contracts (in finance\, several similar p
 ortfolios of asset returns)\,  which are grouped together to share the ris
 k. In insurance\, credibility plays a special role of spreading the risk. 
 In financial terminology\, credibility plays a special role of diversifica
 tion of risk. For each model\, regression credibility models are establish
 ed  and  the robustness of these models is investigated. Applications to F
 ama/French financial portfolio data are also presented.  \n \n \n

 the effects of semantic relationships on human memory search. A variety of

 to realize the cognitive processes involved in memory search. \n In this t

 performs the task in a fashion similar to humans. The model reproduces exp
 erimentally observed response timing effects\, as well as similarity trend
 s within and across semantic categories derived from responses. Three diff
 erent sources of the association data have been tested by embedding associ
 ations in neural connections\, with free association norms providing the b

 er an unknown Boolean function f:{0\,1}^n→{0\,1} is a k-junta or ϵ-far 
 from every k-junta must make Ω(k^(3/2)/ϵ) many queries. This result is
  essentially optimal given Blais's non-adaptive junta tester\, which makes
  O(k^(3/2))/ϵ queries and shows that adaptivity enables polynomial savi
 ngs in query complexity for junta testing. At a very high level\, the proo
 f proceeds by reducing the non-adaptive junta testing of a new class of ra
 ndom Boolean functions to a problem of distinguishing two binomial distrib
 utions with a specific kind of noisy query. \n This is joint work with Xi
