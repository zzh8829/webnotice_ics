DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Verena Kantere\, School of Electrical Engineering an
 d Computer Science\, University of Ottawa\nTitle:   "Adaptive Scalable Ana
 lytics in Multi-Engine Environments" \n\nAbstract:  Big Data analytics in 
 science and industry are performed on a range of heterogeneous data stores
 \, both traditional and modern\, and on a diversity of query engines. Work
 flows are difficult to design and implement since they span a variety of s
 ystems. To reduce development time and processing costs\, some automation 
 is needed.\n In this talk we will present a new platform to manage analyti
 cs workflows. The platform enables workflow design\, execution\, analysis 
 and optimization with respect to time efficiency\, over multiple execution
  engines. Such configurations are emerging as a common paradigm used to co
 mbine analysis of unstructured data with analysis of structured data (e.g.
 \, NoSQL plus SQL). We focus on the usability of the platform by users wit
 h various expertise\, the automation of the analysis and optimization of e
 xecution\, as well as the effect of optimization on workflow execution. Th
 e platform performs also multi-workflow optimisation and workflow recalibr
 ation. The talk will finish with some plans for future research on data ma
 nagement optimization on hybrid infrastructures\, i.e. infrastructures tha
 t comprise multiple sites heterogeneous parts and combine private clusters
  and public resources.\n      \n Bio : Verena Kantere is an

 ted to make a significant impact on a variety of industries. However\, one
  issue holding them back is their limited transaction throughput\, especia
 lly compared to established solutions such as distributed database systems
 .  \n In this talk\, we show how to re-architect a modern permissioned blo
 ckchain system\, Hyperledger Fabric\, to increase transaction throughput f
 rom 3\,000 to 20\,000 transactions per second. We focus on performance bot
 tlenecks beyond the consensus mechanism\, and we propose architectural cha
 nges that reduce computation and I/O overhead during transaction ordering 
 and validation to greatly improve throughput. Notably\, our optimizations 
 are fully plug-and-play and do not require any interface changes to Hyperl
 edger Fabric.\n (Joint work with Stephen Lee\, Lukasz Golab\, and S. Kesha

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Ian Tobasco\, University of Michigan\nTitle:   "The 
 cost of crushing: curvature-driven wrinkling of thin elastic shells" \n\nA
 bstract:  How much energy does it take to stamp a thin elastic shell flat?
  Motivated by recent experiments on wrinkling patterns formed by thin floa
 ting shells\, we develop a rigorous method (via Gamma-convergence) for eva
 luating the cost of crushing to leading order in the shells thickness an
 d other small parameters. The observed patterns involve regions of well-de
 fined wrinkling alongside totally disordered regions where no single direc
 tion of wrinkling is preferred. Our goal is to explain the appearance of s
 uch wrinkling domains. Our analysis proves that energetically optimal 
 patterns maximize their projected planar area subject to a shortness const
 raint. This purely geometric variational problem turns out to be explicitl
 y solvable in many cases of interest\, and a strikingly simple scheme for 
 predicting wrinkle patterns results. We demonstrate our methods with concr
 ete examples and offer comparisons with simulation and experiment.\n This 
 talk will be mathematically self-contained\, not assuming prior background
  in elasticity or calculus of variations.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Jose Serna\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer Sc
 ience\nTitle:   "Dash: Declarative Behavioural Modelling in Alloy" \n\nAbs
 tract:  An abstract model is a representation of the fundamental character
 istics and properties of a system\, and its purpose is to provide feedback
  to stakeholders about the correctness of the system during the early stag
 es of development. This thesis presents Dash\, a new language for the form
 al specification of abstract behavioural models\, which combines the contr
 ol-oriented constructs of statecharts with the declarative modelling of Al
 loy. From statecharts\, Dash inherits a means to specify hierarchy\, concu
 rrency and communication\, three useful aspects to describe the behaviour 
 of reactive systems. From Alloy\, Dash uses the expressiveness of relation
 al logic and set theory to abstractly and declaratively describe structure
 s\, data and operations. \n The purpose of a Dash model is to formally des
 cribe a transition system\, and for this reason transitions are first-clas
 s constructs of the language. Dash provides features such as factoring\, t
 ransition comprehension and layering\, to systematically declare and organ
 ise the transitions of a model. The integration between statecharts and Al
 loy is done in Dash at the semantic level. The semantics of Dash use the n
 otion of big steps and small steps to formally describe changes in a syste
 m\, and address the mismatch between declarative and control-oriented form
 alisms regarding the frame problem. \n We present several case studies to 
 demonstrate the modelling capabilities and automated analysis of Dash mode
 ls. The case studies range from heavily data-oriented systems to highly hi
 erarchical and concurrent systems. Behaviours can be specified using a tem
 poral logic and the Alloy Analyzer is used for performing analyses. We ext
 ended the notion of significance axioms and significant scopes to concurre
 nt Dash models\, to avoid spurious instances of a model and ensure that a 
 big enough search space is explored by the Analyzer to check for interesti
 ng behaviours and provide useful feedback about a model.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Zhengling Qi\, University of North Carolina\nTitle: 
   "Learning Optimal Individualized Decision Rules with Risk Control" \n\nR
 emarks:  Refreshments will be provided.  \n\nAbstract:  With the emergence
  of precision medicine\, estimation of optimal individualized decision rul
 es (IDRs) has attracted tremendous attentions in many scientific areas. Mo
 st existing literature has focused on finding optimal IDRs that can maximi
 ze the expected outcome for each individual. Motivated by complex individu
 alized decision making procedures and the popular conditional value at ris
 k\, in this talk\, I will introduce two new robust criteria to evaluate ID
 Rs: one is focused on the average lower tail of the subjects outcomes an
 d the other is on the individualized lower tail of each subjects outcome
 . The proposed criteria take tail behaviors of the outcome into considerat
 ion\, and thus the resulting optimal IDRs are robust in controlling advers
 e events. The optimal IDRs under our criteria can be interpreted as the di
 stributionally robust decision rules that maximize the worst-case scen
 ario of the outcome within a probability constrained set. Simulation studi
 es and a real data application are used to demonstrate the robust performa
 nce of our methods. Finally\, I will introduce a more general decision-rul
 e based optimized covariates dependent equivalent framework for individual
 ized decision making with risk control.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Maria Papageorgiou\, Department  of Applied Mathemat
 ics\, University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Impacts of relativity on localizab
 ility and vacuum entanglement" \n\nAbstract:  Much of the structure of qua
 ntum field theory (QFT) is predicated on the principle of locality. Adhere
 nce to locality is pursuant to convictions deduced from relativity\, and i
 s achieved in QFT by the association of regions of spacetime with algebras
  of observables. Although\, by construction\, the observables of QFT are l
 ocal objects\, one may also consider characterizing the spatial or spaceti
 me features of a state. For example\, if we have a single-particle state\,
  how can we say that the particle is localized in a certain region of spac
 e? It turns out that such a characterization is obstructed by a collection
  of no-go theorems\, which imply the absence of any suitable position oper
 ator or local number operator in the local algebra of observables. These d
 ifficulties seem to suggest that relativistic QFT cannot support an ontolo
 gy in terms of localizable particles.\n Looking towards low energies\, one
  finds the widespread applicability of non-relativistic quantum mechanics 
 (NRQM)\, a theory in which particle states are localizable by means of the
 ir wavefunction. This seems to imply that NRQM can support a particle onto
 logy\, so it is natural to ask whether one can make contact between the NR
 QM description of particles and some appropriate notion in the latent QFT.
  Admittedly QFT amd NRQM are very different theories\, both at the dynamic
 al and kinematical level\, and recovering one from the other cannot come w
 ith no cost. The main undertaking of this thesis will be to illuminate thi
 s connection\, by starting with a relativistic QFT and making suitable app
 roximations to recover features of NRQM.  \n \n \n

 te University\nTitle:   "Theoretical and Computational Issues in Control a
 nd Optimization of Fluid Flows" \n\nAbstract:  The first part of my talk f
 ocuses on control and optimization of a thermal fluid modeled by the Bouss
 inesq equations. This work was motivated by the design and operation of lo
 w energy consumption buildings. We investigate the problem of feedback sta
 bilization of a fluid flow in natural convection\, which is important in t
 he theory of hydrodynamical stability. In particular\, we are interested i
 n stabilizing a possible unstable steady state solution to the Boussinesq 
 equations in a two dimensional open and bounded domain. The challenge of s
 tabilization of the Boussinesq equations lies in the stabilization of the 
 Navier-Stokes equations and its coupling with the convection-diffusion equ
 ation for temperature. We show that a finite number of controls acting on 
 a portion of the boundary through Neu-mann/Robin type of boundary conditio
 ns is sufficient to locally stabilize the full nonlinear equations. Numeri
 cal experiments are provided to illustrate the concept and its design. The
  second part of my talk discusses the problem of well-posedness and optima
 l control designs for the Boussinesq equations with zero diffusivity and i
 ts application to control of optimal transport and mixing via flow advecti
 on. The\nchallenges in numerical implementation will be addressed.  \n \n

 We will then examine a use case\, gas pumps\, where skimming remains preva

 also fail. After characterizing real skimmers\, we use their properties to
  design the Skim Reaper\, the first external skimmer detection system. Fin
 ally\, successful attacks allow counterfeit cards to be created\; I will d

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Yashar Ganjali\, Department of Computer Science\, Un
 iversity of Toronto\nTitle:   "The Elephant in the Room  On Effectivenes
 s of Using Elephant Flows For Resource Allocation" \n\nAbstract:  A widely
 -used technique to deal with network resource limitations is to focus on e
 lephant flows. The intuition is that since elephant flows carry most of th
 e packets\, allocating resources to them will lead to significant returns.
  In this talk\, we will take a closer look at this technique\, and argue t
 hat we need to rigorously identify objective and cost functions rather tha
 n simply treating elephant flows as the silver bullet for a wide range of 
 network resource allocation problems. Even though this seems like a trivia
 l statement\, a survey of papers published in top networking conferences s
 hows that it is often overlooked.\n As a case study\, we will focus on the
  problem of limited flow table sizes in OpenFlow switches. Typically\, thi
 s problem is solved by allocating the entries to elephant flows\, and usin
 g default catch-all rules for the rest of traffic. Trying to formally defi
 ne the problem\, we'll show how the optimum solution highly dependents on 
 the objective and cost functions. For specific objective and cost function
 s\, we model the problem as a knapsack problem\, analyze how its solution 
 minimizes the table occupancy\, and show the similarities to and differenc
 es from the default idle timeout mechanism in OpenFlow switches.\n Finally
 \, we present a new approach to minimize flow table occupancy based on the
  insight gained from the knapsack model analysis. Our solution expedites r
 ule eviction by forecasting the TCP flow termination from RST/FIN packets\
 , and delays rule installation by incubating non-TCP flows. It reduces ave
 rage flow table occupancy between 16%-62% in various networks for the negl
 igible cost of less than 1.5% reduction in hit ratio.\n     

 stract:  Unlike for the classical Seiberg-Witten equation\, the moduli spa
 ce of the Seiberg-Witten equation with multiple spinors may be non-compact
 . The boundary in this case is modelled on the Seiberg-Witten monopoles wi
 th a singularity along a codimension two subset\, which is referred to as 
 a blow up set. The purpose of this talk is to discuss a lower bound for th
 e 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure of the blow up set when the base manifol
 d is of dimension three.  \n \n \n

 r Science\nTitle:   "Bounds on Maximum Matchings in 1-Planar Graphs" \n\nA
 bstract:  In this thesis\, we study lower bounds on maximum matchings in 1
 -planar graphs. We expand upon the tools used for proofs of matching bound
 s in other classes of graphs as well as some original ideas in order to fi
 nd these bounds. The first novel results we provide are lower bounds of ma
 ximum matching in 1-planar graphs as a function of their minimum degree.\n
  We show that for sufficiently large n\, 1-planar graphs with minimum degr
 ee 3 have a maximum matching of size at least (n+12)/7\, 1-planar graphs w
 ith minimum degree 4 have a maximum matching of size at least (n+4)/3\, an
 d 1-planar graphs with minimum degree 5 have a maximum matching of size at
  least (2n+3)/5. We also give examples of 1-planar graphs with the corresp
 onding minimum degree that meet these bounds\, showing that all of these b
 ounds are tight. We also give examples of 1-planar graphs with small maxim
 um matching and minimum degree 6 and 7. We conjecture that the 1-planar gr
 aph of minimum degree 6 presented has the smallest maximum matching over a
 ll 1-planar graphs of minimum degree 6\, but it is unclear if the method u
 sed for the cases of minimum degree 3\, 4\, and 5 would work for minimum d
 egree 6.\n We also study lower bounds in the class of maximal 1-plane grap
 hs\, and 3-connected maximal 1-plane graphs. We find that 3-connected\, ma
 ximal 1-plane graphs have a maximum matching of size at least (n+4)/3\, an
 d that maximal 1-plane graphs have a maximum matching of size at least (n+
 6)/4. Again\, we present examples of such a graph to show this bound is ti
 ght. We also show that every simple 3-connected maximum 1-planar graph has
  a matching of size at least (2n+6)/5\, and provide some evidence that thi
 s is tight.  \n \n \n

 act:  In the optimal insurance literature\, one typically studies optimal 
 risk sharing between one insurer (or reinsurer) and one policyholder. Howe
 ver\, the insurance business is based on diversification benefits that ari
 se when pooling many insurance policies. In this paper\, we first show tha
 t results on optimal insurance that are valid in the case of a single poli
 cyholder extend to the case of multiple policyholders\, provided their ins
 urance claims are independent. However\, due to natural catastrophes\, inc
 reasing life expectancy and terrorism events\, insurance claims show tende
 ncy to be correlated. Interestingly\, in the case of interdependent insura
 nce policies\, it may become optimal for the insurer to refuse selling ins
 urance to some prospects\, based on their attitude towards risk or due to 
 their risk exposure characteristics. This finding calls for government pol
 icies to ensure that insurance stays available and affordable to everyone.

 :   "Strategies for scaling iterated conditional Sequential Monte Carlo me
 thods for high dimensional state space models" \n\nRemarks:  Refreshments 
 will be provided.  \n\nAbstract:  The iterated Conditional Sequential Mont
 e Carlo (cSMC) method is a particle MCMC method commonly used for state in
 ference in non-linear\, non-Gaussian state space models. Standard implemen
 tations of iterated cSMC provide an efficient way to sample state sequence
 s in low-dimensional state space models. However\, efficiently scaling ite
 rated cSMC methods to perform well in models with a high-dimensional state
  remains a challenge. One reason for this is the use of a global proposal\
 , without reference to the current state sequence in the MCMC run. In high
  dimensions\, such a proposal will typically not be well-matched to the po
 sterior and impede efficient sampling. I will describe a technique based o
 n the embedded HMM (Hidden Markov Model) framework to construct efficient 
 proposals in high dimensions that are local relative to the current state 
 sequence. A second obstacle to scalability of iterated cSMC is not using t
 he entire observed sequence to construct the proposal. Typical implementat
 ions of iterated cSMC use a proposal at time t that that relies only on da
 ta up to time t. In high dimensions and in the presence of informative dat
 a\, such proposals become inefficient\, and can considerably slow down sam
 pling. I will introduce a principled approach to incorporating future obse
 rvations in the cSMC proposal at time t. By considering several examples\,
  I will demonstrate that both strategies improve the performance of iterat
 ed cSMC for sequence sampling in high-dimensional state space models.  \n

 ion of any edge $G$ contains a copy of $H$. For example\, any bipartite gr
 aph is triangle saturated. The {\\em saturation number} of a graph $H$ (de
 noted sat$(n\,H)$) is the minimum number of edges in an $H$ saturated grap
 h on $n$ vertices.  Saturation serves as a complementary question to extre
 mal numbers and has been well studied in the case of graphs. Note that for
  any combinatorial object with a subobject relation we have a notion of sa
 turation. In this talk\, we introduce (induced) saturation in the realm of
  Partially Ordered Sets (Posets).  Joint work with  Michael Ferrara\,  Luc

 ors for Nonparametric Shrinkage and Bayesian Sparsity Inference" \n\nRemar
 ks:  Refreshments will be provided.  \n\nAbstract:  In this talk\, I intro
 duce two novel classes of shrinkage priors for different purposes: functio
 nal HorseShoe (fHS) prior for nonparametric subspace shrinkage and neuroni
 zed priors for general sparsity inference. \n  In function estimation prob
 lems\, the fHS prior encourages shrinkage towards parametric classes of fu
 nctions. Unlike other shrinkage priors for parametric models\, the fHS shr
 inkage acts on the shape of the function rather than inducing sparsity on 
 model parameters. I study some desirable theoretical properties including 
 an optimal posterior concentration property on the function and the model 
 selection consistency. I apply the fHS prior to nonparametric additive mod
 els for some simulated and real data sets\, and the results show that the 
 proposed procedure outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of es
 timation and model selection.\n  For general sparsity inference\, I propos
 e the neuronized priors to unify and extend existing shrinkage priors such
  as one-group continuous shrinkage priors\, continuous spike-and-slab prio
 rs\, and discrete spike-and-slab priors with point-mass mixtures. The new 
 priors are formulated as the product of a weight variable and a transforme
 d scale variable via an activation function.  By altering the activation f
 unction\, practitioners can easily implement a large class of Bayesian var
 iable selection procedures. Compared with classic spike and slab priors\, 
 the neuronized priors achieve the same explicit variable selection without
  employing any latent indicator variable\, which results in more efficient
  MCMC algorithms and more effective posterior modal estimates. I also show
  that these new formulations can be applied to more general and complex sp
 arsity inference problems\, which are computationally challenging\, such a
 s structured sparsity and spatially correlated sparsity problems.  \n \n \

 cian edge state transfer\, that is\, the quantum walks whose initial state
 s are edge states $e_a-e_b$and Hamiltonians are the Laplacians of the unde
 rlying graphs. \n We will extend some known results of vertex state transf
 er to Laplacian edge state transfer and introduce some basic properties of
  Laplacian edge state transfer. We will prove two useful closure propertie
 s for perfect Laplacian edge state transfer. One is that complementation p
 reserves perfect edge state transfer.  The other is that if $G$ has vertex
  state transfer and $H$ has edge state transfer\, then with some mild assu
 mption on the pairs of vertex states and edge states that have perfect sta
 te transfer\, the Cartesian product $G\\square H$also admits perfect edge 
 state transfer. We will talk about one interesting transitivity phenomenon
  that happens in Laplacian edge state transfer which never happens in vert
 ex state transfer.\n We will give characterizations of perfect Laplacian e
 dge state transfer in cycles\, paths. We will also briefly mention the cas
 e when the unsigned Laplacian is Hamiltonian and initial states are plus s

 ne duality for Boolean algebras and Priestley duality for distributive lat
 tices\, are mediated by a schizophrenic pair consisting of a finite al
 gebra generating the algebraic category together with a topological struct
 ure having the same universe as\, and compatible with\, the finite generat
 ing algebra.  For example\, the schizophrenic pair for Stone duality consi
 sts of the 2-element Boolean algebra together with the 2-element set viewe
 d as a discrete space\, while the schizophrenic pair for Priestley duality
  consists of the 2-element distributive lattice together with the 2-elemen
 t total order (again viewed as a discrete space).  A long-standing open pr
 oblem in the field of natural dualities asked if every schizophrenic pair 
 is equivalent to one in which the topological structure has only finitely 
 many operations and relations in its signature.\n This problem was finally
  solved by Jane Pitkethly in 2011.  In this talk I will describe the schiz
 ophrenic pairs that she constructed for this purpose and begin their analy

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Patrick Speissegger\, McMaster University\nTitle:   
 "Limit cycles of planar vector fields\, Hilberts 16th problem and o-mini
 mality" \n\nAbstract:  Recent work links certain aspects of the second par
 t of\nHilberts 16th problem (H16) to the theory of o-minimality.  One of
 \nthese aspects is the generation and destruction of limit cycles in\nfami
 lies of planar vector fields\, commonly referred to as\nbifurcations. 
  I will outline the significance of bifurcations for H16\nand explain how 
 logicin particular\, o-minimalitycan be used to\nunderstand them well 
 enough to be able to count limit cycles.  \n \n \n

  Science\nTitle:   "Applications of Artificial Intelligence to the NHL Ent
 ry Draft" \n\nAbstract:  This thesis investigates the application of vario
 us fields of artificial intelligence to the domain of sports management an
 d analysis. The research in this thesis is primarily focused on the entry 
 draft for the National Hockey League\, though many of the models proposed 
 may be applied to other sports and leagues with minimal adjustments. \n A 
 utility model is proposed to define which players are preferred by which t
 eams for a given draft. This model allows for the consideration of how tea
 ms acting in a multiagent system may reason about each other's preferences
 \, as well as how they might strategize and interact with one another thro
 ugh trades. \n A trading scheme where agents may trade picks with each oth
 er to change the picking order is established and an algorithm is proposed
  to find optimal trade offers to propose under an imperfect knowledge sett
 ing. Through simulations based on the National Hockey League Entry Draft d
 ata\, the algorithms provide mutually beneficial trades that also increase
  the social utility of the league over the course of the draft. Machine le
 arning classifiers are proposed to suggest which prospects will be success
 ful at the highest level of the sport over various metrics using statistic
 s and scouting reports from their draft year as features. \n The classifie
 rs outperform conventional draft selections in the NHL and provide insight
 s into which attributes of a player are important in development. Clusteri
 ng techniques are used to determine playstyles in the NHL and these cluste
 rs are fed as annotations into additional classifiers to project which pro
 spects will fall into certain clusters later in their careers. \n These la
 tter classifiers demonstrated promising results but were ultimately limite
 d by the availability of data. A discussion of future avenues of artificia
 l intelligence research in the young but growing field of sports analytics
  is carried throughout this thesis.  \n \n \n

 cience\nTitle:   "Formal Methods in Quantum Circuit Design" \n\nAbstract: 
  The design and compilation of correct\, efficient quantum circuits is int
 egral to the future operation of quantum computers. This thesis makes cont
 ributions to the problems of optimizing and verifying quantum circuits\, w
 ith an emphasis on the development of formal models for such purposes. We 
 also present software implementations of these methods\, which together fo
 rm a full stack of tools for the design of optimized\, formally verified q
 uantum oracles.\n On the optimization side\, we study methods for the opti
 mization of Rz and CNOT gates in Clifford+Rz circuits. We develop a genera
 l\, efficient optimization algorithm called phase folding\, which reduces 
 the number of Rz gates without increasing any metrics by computing its pha
 se polynomial. This algorithm can further be combined with synthesis techn
 iques for CNOT-dihedral operators to optimize circuits with respect to par
 ticular costs. We then study the optimal synthesis problem for CNOT-dihedr
 al operators from the perspectives of Rz and CNOT gate optimization. In th
 e case of Rz gate optimization\, we show that the optimal synthesis proble
 m is polynomial-time equivalent to minimum-distance decoding in certain Re
 ed-Muller codes. For the CNOT optimization problem\, we show that the opti
 mal synthesis problem is at least as hard as a combinatorial problem relat
 ed to Gray codes. In both cases\, we develop heuristics for the optimal sy
 nthesis problem\, which together with phase folding reduces T counts by 42
 % and CNOT counts by 21% across a suite of real-world benchmarks.\n From t
 he perspective of formal verification\, we make two contributions. The fir
 st is the development of a novel formal model of quantum circuits with anc
 illary bits\, along with a concrete verification algorithm. The formal mod
 el is based on the Feynman path integral\, and with some syntactic sugar f
 orms a natural specification language for quantum circuits. Our experiment
 s show some practical circuits with up to hundreds of qubits can be effici
 ently verified. Our second contribution is a formally verified\, optimizin
 g compiler for reversible circuits. The compiler compiles a classical\, ir
 reversible language to reversible circuits\, with a formal\, machine-check
 ed proof of correctness written in the proof assistant F*. The compiler is
  structured as a partial evaluator\, allowing verification to be carried o
 ut significantly faster than previous results.  \n \n \n

 Azumaya Algebras and the Resolution Property" \n\nAbstract:  Azumaya algeb
 ras\, are (etale) twisted forms of matrix rings. These objects are of grea
 t utility because they give rise to Brauer classes. Fifty years ago\, Grot
 hendieck asked whether every cohomological Brauer class has a correspondin
 g Azumaya algebra. This question is still open even for smooth separated t
 hreefolds over the complex numbers!\nOne says a scheme (or Algebraic stack
 ) X satisfies the resolution property if every coherent sheaf is the quoti
 ent of a vector bundle. The work of Totaro and Gross explains that this pr
 operty holds iff X admits a very special quotient stack presentation. Howe
 ver\, whether or not separated Algebraic stacks have this property remains
  a difficult question.\n The goal of our talk will be to explain\n (1) Why
  these two questions are deeply intertwined\,\n (2) New results regarding 
 the existence of Azumaya Algebras and\n (3) How we can use results as in (
 2) to show large classes of algebraic stacks satisfy the resolution proper
 ty.  \n \n \n

 "The Cost of Privacy: Optimal Rates of Convergence for Parameter Estimatio
 n with Differential Privacy" \n\nRemarks:  Refreshments will be provided. 
  \n\nAbstract:  With the unprecedented availability of datasets containing
  personal information\, there are increasing concerns that statistical ana
 lysis of such datasets may compromise individual privacy. These concerns g
 ive rise to statistical methods that provide privacy guarantees at the cos
 t of some statistical accuracy. A fundamental question is: to satisfy cert
 ain desired level of privacy\, what is the best statistical accuracy one c
 an achieve?  Standard statistical methods fail to yield sharp results\, an
 d new technical tools are called for.\n In this talk\, I will present a ge
 neral lower bound argument to investigate the tradeoff between statistical
  accuracy and privacy\, with application to three problems: mean estimatio
 n\, linear regression and classification\, in both the classical low-dimen
 sional and modern high-dimensional settings. For these statistical problem
 s\, we also design computationally efficient algorithms that match the min
 imax lower bound under the privacy constraints. Finally I will show the ap
 plications of those privacy-preserving algorithms to real data containing 
 sensitive information\, such as SNPs and body fat\, for which privacy-pres
 erving statistical methods are necessary.  \n \n \n

 em of testing multiple hypotheses with streaming (sequential) data arises 
 in diverse applications such as multi-channel signal processing\, surveill
 ance systems\, multi-endpoint clinical trials\, and online surveys. In thi
 s talk\, we investigate the problem under two generalized error metrics. U
 nder the first one\, the probability of at least k mistakes\, of any kind\
 , is controlled. Under the second\, the probabilities of at least k1 false
  positives and at least k2 false negatives are simultaneously controlled. 
 For each formulation\, we characterize the optimal expected sample size to
  a first-order asymptotic approximation as the error probabilities vanish\
 , and propose a novel procedure that is asymptotically efficient under eve
 ry signal configuration.  These results are established when the data stre
 ams for the various hypotheses are independent and each local log-likeliho
 od ratio statistic satisfies a certain law of large numbers. Further\, in 
 the special case of iid observations\, we quantify the asymptotic gains of
  sequential sampling over fixed-sample size schemes.  \n \n \n

 ditionally by testing for equivalence. We explain how such a policy could 
 address issues of publication bias\, and investigate similarities with a B

 urrent incentives to publish\, predicts a researcher's most rational use o

 is information theoretically possible to recover the tensor with a finite 
 number of samples via maximum likelihood estimation\, however\, it is expe
 cted that one needs a polynomially diverging number of samples to efficien
 tly recover it. What is the cause if this large statistical-to-algorithmic
  gap? To understand this interesting question of high dimensional statisti
 cs\, we begin by studying an intimately related question: optimization of 
 random homogenous polynomials on the sphere in high dimensions. We show th
 at the estimation threshold is related to a geometric analogue of the BBP 
 transition for matrices. We then study the threshold for efficient recover
 y for a simple class of algorithms\, Langevin dynamics and gradient descen
 t. We view this problem in terms of a broader class of polynomial optimiza
 tion problems and propose a mechanism or success/failure of recovery in te
 rms of the strength of the signal on the high entropy region of the initia
 lization. We will review several results including joint works with Ben Ar

  Computer experiments provide useful tools for investigating complex syste

 oduced and studied a class of space-ﬁlling designs\, strong orthogonal a
 rrays. To date\, an important problem that has not been addressed in the l
 iterature is that of design selection for such arrays. In this talk\, I wi
 ll ﬁrst give a broad introduction to space-ﬁlling designs\, and then p
 resent some results on the selection of strong orthogonal arrays.\n The se
 cond part of my talk will present some preliminary work on the application
  of space-ﬁlling designs to big data research. Nowadays\, it is challeng
 ing to use current computing resources to analyze super-large datasets. Su
 bsampling-based methods are the common approaches to reducing data sizes\,
  with the leveraging method (Ma and Sun\, 2014) being the most popular. Re
 cently\, a new approach\, information-based optimal subdata selection (IBO
 SS) method was proposed (Wang\, Yang and Stufken\, 2018)\, which applies t
 he design methodology to the big data problem. However\, both the leveragi

 nAbstract:  Organizations are increasingly interested in allowing external
  data scientists to explore their sensitive datasets. Due to the popularit
 y of differential privacy\, data owners want the data exploration to ensur
 e provable privacy guarantees. However\, current systems for differentiall
 y private query answering place an inordinate burden on the data analysts 
 to understand differential privacy\, manage their privacy budget and even 
 implement new algorithms for noisy query answering. Moreover\, current sys
 tems do not provide any guarantees to the data analyst on the quantity the
 y care about\, namely accuracy of query answers.\n In this paper\, we pres
 ent APEx\, a novel system that allows data analysts to pose adaptively cho
 sen sequences of queries along with accuracy bounds. By translating querie
 s and accuracy bounds into differentially private algorithms with the leas
 t privacy loss\, APEx returns query answers to the data analyst that meet 
 the accuracy bounds and proves to the data owner that the entire data expl
 oration process is differentially private. Our comprehensive experimental 
 study on real datasets demonstrates that APEx can answer a variety of quer
 ies accurately with moderate to small privacy loss\, and can support data 
 exploration for performing entity resolution tasks with high accuracy unde
 r reasonable privacy settings.\n This work has been accepted and to appear

 explicit models of bacterial cellulose degradation" \n\nAbstract:  Cellulo
 sic ethanol is a biofuel that is produced from non-edible plants and plant
  materials\, such switchgrass and corn stover. It can have a positive net 
 energy output with a reduction in green house gas emissions that is drasti
 cally lower than that of cornbased ethanol and fossil fuels. Clostridium t
 hermocellum is a bacteria that is able to directly convert cellulose into 
 ethanol (and other by products). These bacteria colonize cellulose materia
 l and degrade cellulose by "chewing" their way through their substrate. In
  this talk we first present a very simple\, spatially implicit reactor sca
 le model for cellulose degradation by C.thermocellum biofilms. This ODE ca
 n be studied with elementary techniques and quantitatively compared agains
 t experimental data. However\, it does not allow for a detailed descriptio
 n of the spatial effects as the bacteria break down their substratum. To a
 ddress this\, we formulate then a spatially explicit model\, which consist
 s of a highly degenrate diffusion-reaction equation for bacterial biomas t
 hat is couled with an oridnary differential equation for the growth limiti
 ng substrate. We study this model numerically and qualitatively compare si
 mulation results against experimental observations. The simulations sugges
 t the existence of a traveling wave\; time permitting we investigate those
  in a simplified setting in more detail.  \n \n
