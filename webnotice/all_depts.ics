DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Michael Deveau\,\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, U
 niversity of WaterlooTitle: "Computable Functors and Effective Interpret
 ability"\nAbstract: We introduce the notion of a computable functor and 
 the definition of effective inter- pretability. The former is a computable
  analogue of a category-theoretic functor between ω-presentations of stru
 ctures\, and the latter is an effective version of model-theoretic inter- 
 pretability. We show that effective interpretations induce computable func
 tors\, and briefly mention the converse. \n\n \n

  Given a base 1\\less q\\le 2\, following Renyi (1957) we consider expansi
 ons of the form\nx=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{c_i}{q^i}\nwith digits $c_i
 $ belonging to $\\{0\,1\\}$.\nIn case $q=2$ of the familiar binary expansi
 ons every $x\\in [0\,1]$ has an expansion\, and this is unique except the 
 dyadic rational numbers that have two expansions. \nThe case $1We determin
 e the values of $q$ for which $U_q$ is closed or even a Cantor set. \nThes
 e values have unexpected number-theoretical properties.\nMoreover\, we det
 ermine the Hausdorff dimension of the sets $U_q$.\nIt turns out to depend 
 on $q$ in a quite intricate way.\nOur survey is mostly based on joint rese

  Game"\nAbstract: Textbooks\, as supplementary material\, are known to imp
 rove student outcomes by accommodating multiple learning types and reinfor
 cing material learned in class\; however\, most students do not often comp
 lete assigned readings. We created Reading Garden\, a motivational game ai
 med to get students to read more of the textbook. Reading Garden is a casu
 al\, multiplayer game following common design patterns of many social game
 s. For example\, it follows the free-to-play model\, where the game can al
 ways be played for free\, but has special advanced actions and decorations
  that can be purchased with gold  a special in-game currency. Players ea
 rn gold by completing assigned readings.\nWe then deployed Reading Garden 
 in three iterations of a human computer interaction courses\, in two diffe
 rent departments\, at the University of Waterloo. Each study featured an e
 ntire class playing the game simultaneously throughout the four-month term
 . This talk will discuss the results of those ecologically valid deploymen
 ts\, as well as the ethical challenges associated with conducting studies 
 in classrooms. \n\n \n

 uld be easier if all variables were uncorrelated and all data sets consist
 ed of orthogonal x-variables. Principal components is one way of obtaining
  orthogonal/uncorrelated variables\, but the relationship between the prin
 cipal components and the original x-variables is complex. This talk propos
 es two transformations that give orthogonal/uncorrelated components with a
  close one-to-one correspondence between the x-variables and the component
 s.\nThe transformations have a number of useful applications including:\na
  unified approach to the identification and diagnosis of collinearities\ne
 valuating the contributions of individual variables to a Mahalanobis dista
 nce or the test statistic of a Hotelling test\nsetting prior weights for B
 ayesian model averaging\nevaluating the contributions of individual variab
 les to a multiple regression\ncalculation of an upper bound for a multivar

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Dr. Julia Chuzhoy\, Toyota Technological Institute at
  ChicagoTitle: "Graph Routing Problems: Approximation\, Hardness\, and Gra
 ph-Theoretic Insights"\nAbstract: In a typical routing problem\, we are gi
 ven a graph G\, and a collection(s_1\,t_1)\,..\,(s_k\,t_k) of pairs of its
  vertices\, called demand pairs\, that we would like to route. In order to
  route a demand pair (s_i\,t_i)\, we need to choose a path connecting s_i 
 to t_i in G. Our goal is usually to route as many of the demand pairs as p
 ossible\, while keeping the congestion of the routing - the maximum load o
 n any vertex or an edge of G - as small as possible. This general framewor
 k gives rise to a number of basic and widely studied graph routing problem
 s\, that have lead to the development of a rich toolkit of algorithmic tec
 hniques\, as well as structural graph theoretic results. In this talk we w
 ill describe some of the recent developments in approximation algorithms f
 or graph routing problems\, and highlight some connections between this ar
 ea and graph theory. \n\n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Marthe Boname\, University of BordeauxTitle: "Tight l
 ower bounds for the complexity of multicoloring"\nAbstract: In the multico
 loring problem\, also known as $(a:b)$ or $b$-fold coloring\, we are given
  a graph $G$ and a set of a colors\, and the task is to assign a subset of
  $b$ colors to each vertex of $G$ so that adjacent vertices receive disjoi
 nt color subsets. This natural generalization of the classic coloring prob
 lem (the $b=1$ case) is equivalent to finding a homomorphism to the Kneser
  graph with parameters a and b. It is tightly connected with the fractiona
 l chromatic number\, and has multiple applications within computer science
 .\nWe study the complexity of determining whether a graph has an $(a:b)$-c
 oloring. Nederlof showed in 2008 a $(b+1)^n*n^O(1)$-time algorithm for $(a
 :b)$-coloring. Our main result is that this is essentially optimal: there 
 is no algorithm with running time $2^o(log b)⋅n$ unless the Exponential 
 Time Hypothesis fails. The crucial ingredient in our hardness reduction is
  the usage of detecting matrices of Lindstr| om (1965)\, which is a comb
 inatorial tool that\, to the best of our knowledge\, has not yet been used
  for proving complexity lower bounds. This talk is also meant as an introd
 uction to the ETH.\nThis is joint work with  {\\L}ukasz Kowalik\, Micha{\\

 ienceTitle: "Bidder Profiling by Acquisition and Analysis of Market Data i
 n Water Distribution Industry"\nAbstract: The project involves the analysi
 s of procurement auctions for water infrastructure maintenance projects fo
 r Cities of Niagara Falls and London. The primary concern of this proposal
  is to generate a reliable mechanism for importing different formats of th
 e tender summaries\, provided as input data\, of the projects and unify th
 em in a database for further exploration and processing. For this part of 
 the research\, I developed a water infrastructure ontology to standardize 
 the different aspects of the knowledge available in this field\, which wou
 ld eventually help us to import the data and look for any contextual incon
 sistencies and errors and act appropriately to repair them.\nThe next part
  of the project\, the primary focus the study\, is to analyze the historic
 al auction data to extract various valuable pieces of information from the
 m such as inflation rate and unit project prices. Also\, it is possible to
  look into generating a profile of each recurrent bidder (contractor) and 
 establish the statistical likelihood model of their behaviour. Therefore\,
  any future auction can be inspected and compared to these profiles and an
 y discrepancies or unexpected or highly unlikely behaviour that would rais
 e a red flag can be found for further investigation. A comprehensive list 
 of features that can act as the indicators of bidder behaviour is presente
 d in this proposal\, as well. The preliminary goal is to minimize the prob
 ability of any possible collusion (or find them if any exists) and detect 
 unusual behaviours that might exist in the procurement auctions. \n\n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Dr. Richard Stanley\, MITTitle: "Smith Normal Form an

 and $A$ an $n\\times n$ matrix over $R$. Suppose there exist $n\\times n$ 
 matrices $P\,Q$ invertible over $R$ for which $PAQ$ is a diagonal matrix d
 iag$(e_1\,\\dots\,e_r\,0\,\\dots\,0)$\, where $e_i$ divides $e_{i+1}$ in $
 R$. We then call $PAQ$ a \\emph{Smith normal form}(SNF) of $A$. If $R$ is 
 a PID then an SNF always exists and is unique up to multiplication by unit
 s. Moreover if $A$ is invertible then $\\det A=u\\alpha_1\\cdots \\alpha n
 $\, where $u$ is a unit\, so SNF gives a canonical factorization of $\\det
  A$.\nWe will survey some connections between SNF and combinatorics. Topic
 s will include (1) the general theory of SNF\, (2) a close connection betw
 een SNF and chip firing in graphs\, (3) the SNF of a random matrix of inte
 gers (joint work with Yinghui Wang)\, (4) SNF of special classes of matric

  however\, public ledgers cannot achieve their enormous potential.\nAlgora
 nd is a quite alternative\, truly democratic\, and very efficient way to i

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Terry Lyons\, Oxford UniversityTitle: "From Hopf Alge
 bras to Machine learning via Rough Paths"\nAbstract: Rough path theory aim
 s to build an effective calculus that can model the interactions between c
 omplex oscillatory (rough) evolving systems. At its mathematical foundatio
 ns\, it is a combination of analysis blended with algebra that goes back t
 o LC Young\, and to KT Chen. Key to the theory is the essential need to in
 corporate additional non-commutative structure into areas of mathematics w
 e thought were stable. At its high points\, there are the regularity struc
 tures of Martin Hairer that allow robust meaning to be given to numerous c
 ore nonlinear stochastic pdes describing evolving interfaces in physics.\n
 Classic results\, by Clark\, Cameron and Dickinson\, demonstrate that a no
 nlinear approach to the data is essential.  Rough path theory lives up to 
 this challenge and can be viewed as providing fundamentally more efficient
  ways of approximately describing complex data\; approaches that\, after p
 enetrating the basic ideas\, are computationally tractable and lead to new
  scalable ways to regress\, classify\, and learn functional relationships 
 from data. One non-mathematical application that is already striking is th
 e use of signatures on a daily basis in the online recognition of Chinese 
 Handwriting on mobile phones. \n\n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Ivana Kajić\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer S
 cienceTitle: "A Biologically Constrained Model of Semantic Memory Search"\
 nAbstract: The semantic fluency task has been used to understand the effec
 ts of semantic relationships on human memory search. A variety of computat
 ional models have been proposed that explain human behavioral data\, yet i
 t remains unclear how millions of spiking neurons work in unison to realiz
 e the cognitive processes involved in memory search. \nIn this talk\, I wi
 ll present a biologically constrained neural network model that performs t
 he task in a fashion similar to humans. The model reproduces experimentall
 y observed response timing effects\, as well as similarity trends within a
 nd across semantic categories derived from responses. Three different sour
 ces of the association data have been tested by embedding associations in 
 neural connections\, with free association norms providing the best match.
