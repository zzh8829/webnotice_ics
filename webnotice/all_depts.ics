DESCRIPTION:The Hales-Jewett Theorem\nShouzhen Gu\, Department of Pure Mat
 hematics\, University of Waterloo\n\nWe give a proof of Schur's Theorem\, 
 which states that if the\nintegers from 1 to $N$ are coloured using $r$ co
 lours\, then for\nsufficiently large $N$\, there will be a monochromatic s
 olution to $x+y=z$.\nThen\, we present the Hales-Jewett Theorem on the exi
 stence of\nmonochromatic combinatorial lines in the integer points of a hy
 percube of\nhigh enough dimension. As a corollary\, we can find monochroma
 tic\narithmetic progressions of any given length in the integers from 1 to
  $N$\nfor large enough $N$\, which demonstrates van der Waerden's Theorem.

DESCRIPTION:On the Theory and Application of Early Warning Signals for Cri
 tical Transitions\nTom Bury\, Department of Applied Mathematics\n\nAbrupt 
 and often irreversible transitions can be observed in a wide variety of sy
 stems including ecological communities\, complex disease and social networ
 ks. These so-called 'critical transitions' can be brought on by a gradual 
 change in external conditions that quietly reduce the resilience of a syst
 em. Despite their seemingly unpredictable nature\, generic early warning s
 ignals have been proposed which\, once verified for a particular system\, 
 could provide the means for mitigating or even preventing unwanted transit
 ions. However\, in higher dimensions\, the typical early warning signals c
 an become amplified\, muted\, or even reversed\, due to the intricate vari
 able interactions in the approach to the transition. In addition\, these m
 ore complex systems can exhibit a wider variety of transitions to their si
 mplified counterparts. This thesis aims to pin down the mechanisms that ca
 use these particular alterations in early warning signals\, which may then
  work in our favour by helping us characterise the transition being approa
 ched. Working alongside models in the social\, ecological and biological s
 ciences\, we hope to contribute the the challenging task of detecting near
 by critical transitions in these fields.

  $k$-edge matchings of a graph $G$.  It has a stronger multivariate versio
 n. I will describe a general method which produces theorems of this type\,
  with the set of matchings of $G$ replaced by the set of $(f\,g)$-factors 
 of $G$:\\ for any two functions $f\,g:V(G)\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N}$\, an \\
 emph{$(f\,g)$-factor} $H$ is a spanning subgraph such that $f(v) \\leq \\d

DESCRIPTION:Some connectivity results for 2-polymatroids\nJames Oxley\, Lo
 uisiana State University\n\nFor a graph $G$ and each subset  $X$ of $E(G)$
 \, let $r(X)$ be the number of vertices incident with some edge in $X$.  F
 rom the pair $(E(G)\,r)$\, which is an example of a $2$-polymatroid\, one 
 can detemine $G$ up to isolated vertices and one can recognize matchings i
 n $G$. The cycle matroid in $G$ does not allow the determination of either
  of these things. Loosely speaking\, a $2$-polymatroid is like a matroid e
 xcept that individual elements can have rank $2$ instead of just $0$ or $1
 $. In joint work with Charles Semple and Geoff Whittle\, the speaker has b
 een seeking connectivity results for $2$-polymatroids that resemble corres
 ponding results for matroids.

DESCRIPTION:The Mathematical Contributions of W.T. Tutte\nDr. James Oxley\
 , Louisiana State University\n\n"If a theorem about graphs can be expresse
 d in terms of edges and circuits only it probably exemplifies a more gener
 al theorem about matroids". Bill Tutte wrote these words in a commentary o
 n his 1966 paper 'Connectivity in matroids'. Indeed\, he went on to write 
 that a "belief in this general principle" led him to seek a matroid genera
 lization of his 1961 theorem that distinguishes the special role that whee
 ls play among 3-connected graphs. Because of the impossibility of doing ju
 stice to all of Bill's mathematical contributions in a single colloquium\,
  this talk will concentrate on those contributions that lie on the interfa
 ce between graph theory and matroid theory.

DESCRIPTION:Graph Routing Problems: Approximation\, Hardness\, and Graph-T
 heoretic Insights\nDr. Julia Chuzhoy\, Toyota Technological Institute at C
 hicago\n\nIn a typical routing problem\, we are given a graph G\, and a co
 llection(s_1\,t_1)\,..\,(s_k\,t_k) of pairs of its vertices\, called deman
 d pairs\, that we would like to route. In order to route a demand pair (s_
 i\,t_i)\, we need to choose a path connecting s_i to t_i in G. Our goal is
  usually to route as many of the demand pairs as possible\, while keeping 
 the congestion of the routing - the maximum load on any vertex or an edge 
 of G - as small as possible. This general framework gives rise to a number
  of basic and widely studied graph routing problems\, that have lead to th
 e development of a rich toolkit of algorithmic techniques\, as well as str
 uctural graph theoretic results. In this talk we will describe some of the
  recent developments in approximation algorithms for graph routing problem
 s\, and highlight some connections between this area and graph theory.

  of analysis blended with algebra that goes back to LC Young\, and to KT C
