DESCRIPTION:Computable Functors and Effective Interpretability\nMichae
 l Deveau\,\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\nPure
  Mathematics\nComputability Learning Seminar\n\n\nWe introduce the notion 
 of a computable functor and the definition of effective inter- pretability
 . The former is a computable analogue of a category-theoretic functor betw
 een ω-presentations of structures\, and the latter is an effective versio
 n of model-theoretic inter- pretability. We show that effective interpreta
 tions induce computable functors\, and briefly mention the converse.

  the second of four main steps of the construction: resolving the orbifold
  singularities by performing a fibre-wise blow up. The important point is 
 that there is no natural torsion-free G2 structure on this third glueing r
 egion. The natural G2 structure is not even closed. There is a natural way
  to correct it to be closed\, which we will discuss. The third step is cor
 recting this further to remove the leading error term in the torsion\, whi

 terpreting the results of a statistical analysis would be easier if all va
 riables were uncorrelated and all data sets consisted of orthogonal x-vari
 ables. Principal components is one way of obtaining orthogonal/uncorrelate
 d variables\, but the relationship between the principal components and th
 e original x-variables is complex. This talk proposes two transformations 
 that give orthogonal/uncorrelated components with a close one-to-one corre
 spondence between the x-variables and the components.\nRefreshments will b

 heoretic Insights\nDr. Julia Chuzhoy\, Toyota Technological Institute at C
 hicago\nCombinatorics and Optimization\nSeminar\n\n\nIn a typical routing 
 problem\, we are given a graph G\, and a collection(s_1\,t_1)\,..\,(s_k\,t
 _k) of pairs of its vertices\, called demand pairs\, that we would like to
  route. In order to route a demand pair (s_i\,t_i)\, we need to choose a p
 ath connecting s_i to t_i in G. Our goal is usually to route as many of th
 e demand pairs as possible\, while keeping the congestion of the routing -
  the maximum load on any vertex or an edge of G - as small as possible. Th
 is general framework gives rise to a number of basic and widely studied gr
 aph routing problems\, that have lead to the development of a rich toolkit
  of algorithmic techniques\, as well as structural graph theoretic results
 . In this talk we will describe some of the recent developments in approxi
 mation algorithms for graph routing problems\, and highlight some connecti
 ons between this area and graph theory.

 a gallery of graphs illustrating some classification results\, started by 
 Deborah Lockett\, and which I subsequently expanded on.  For my friends in
  PMATH\, this should serve as a gentle and entertaining introduction to th

DESCRIPTION:Tight lower bounds for the complexity of multicoloring\nMarthe
  Boname\, University of Bordeaux\nCombinatorics and Optimization\nColloqui
 um\n\n\nIn the multicoloring problem\, also known as $(a:b)$ or $b$-fold c
 oloring\, we are given a graph $G$ and a set of a colors\, and the task is
  to assign a subset of $b$ colors to each vertex of $G$ so that adjacent v
 ertices receive disjoint color subsets. This natural generalization of the
  classic coloring problem (the $b=1$ case) is equivalent to finding a homo
 morphism to the Kneser graph with parameters a and b. It is tightly connec
 ted with the fractional chromatic number\, and has multiple applications w
 ithin computer science.\nWe study the complexity of determining whether a 
 graph has an $(a:b)$-coloring. Nederlof showed in 2008 a $(b+1)^n*n^O(1)$-
 time algorithm for $(a:b)$-coloring. Our main result is that this is essen
 tially optimal: there is no algorithm with running time $2^o(log b)⋅n$ u
 nless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails. The crucial ingredient in our
  hardness reduction is the usage of detecting matrices of Lindstr| om (1
 965)\, which is a combinatorial tool that\, to the best of our knowledge\,
  has not yet been used for proving complexity lower bounds. This talk is a
 lso meant as an introduction to the ETH.

 is a diagonal matrix diag$(e_1\,\\dots\,e_r\,0\,\\dots\,0)$\, where $e_i$ 
 divides $e_{i+1}$ in $R$. We then call $PAQ$ a \\emph{Smith normal form}(S
 NF) of $A$. If $R$ is a PID then an SNF always exists and is unique up to 
 multiplication by units. Moreover if $A$ is invertible then $\\det A=u\\al
