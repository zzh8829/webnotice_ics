DESCRIPTION:Computable Functors and Effective Interpretability\nMichae
 l Deveau\,\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\n\nWe
  introduce the notion of a computable functor and the definition of effect
 ive inter- pretability. The former is a computable analogue of a category-
 theoretic functor between ω-presentations of structures\, and the latter 
 is an effective version of model-theoretic inter- pretability. We show tha
 t effective interpretations induce computable functors\, and briefly menti
 on the converse.

 tephen Wen\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\n\nWe
  provide a proof of the Prime Number Theorem over function fields. We exam
 ine and extend techniques used in a zeta function proof of the theorem to 
 other applications such as counting square- and higher power- free polynom
 ials of a given degree. If time permits\, Dirichlet Series will be in- tro
 duced with an aim towards proving the analogue of Dirichlets Theorem on pr
 imes in arithmetic progressions.

  accommodating multiple learning types and reinforcing material learned in
  class\; however\, most students do not often complete assigned readings. 
 We created Reading Garden\, a motivational game aimed to get students to r
 ead more of the textbook. Reading Garden is a casual\, multiplayer game fo
 llowing common design patterns of many social games. For example\, it foll
 ows the free-to-play model\, where the game can always be played for free\
 , but has special advanced actions and decorations that can be purchased w
 ith gold  a special in-game currency. Players earn gold by completing as
 signed readings.

 ion from graph embeddings. The underlying theory uses Viennot's theory of

 tion: resolving the orbifold singularities by performing a fibre-wise blow
  up. The important point is that there is no natural torsion-free G2 struc
 ture on this third glueing region. The natural G2 structure is not even cl
 osed. There is a natural way to correct it to be closed\, which we will di
 scuss. The third step is correcting this further to remove the leading err
 or term in the torsion\, which is the third main step.

 ite\, the Open University\n\nRefreshments will be provided.\nInterpreting 
 the results of a statistical analysis would be easier if all variables wer
 e uncorrelated and all data sets consisted of orthogonal x-variables. Prin
 cipal components is one way of obtaining orthogonal/uncorrelated variables
 \, but the relationship between the principal components and the original 
 x-variables is complex. This talk proposes two transformations that give o
 rthogonal/uncorrelated components with a close one-to-one correspondence b
 etween the x-variables and the components.

DESCRIPTION:Graph Routing Problems: Approximation\, Hardness\, and Graph-T
 heoretic Insights\nDr. Julia Chuzhoy\, Toyota Technological Institute at C
 hicago\n\nIn a typical routing problem\, we are given a graph G\, and a co
 llection(s_1\,t_1)\,..\,(s_k\,t_k) of pairs of its vertices\, called deman
 d pairs\, that we would like to route. In order to route a demand pair (s_
 i\,t_i)\, we need to choose a path connecting s_i to t_i in G. Our goal is
  usually to route as many of the demand pairs as possible\, while keeping 
 the congestion of the routing - the maximum load on any vertex or an edge 
 of G - as small as possible. This general framework gives rise to a number
  of basic and widely studied graph routing problems\, that have lead to th
 e development of a rich toolkit of algorithmic techniques\, as well as str
 uctural graph theoretic results. In this talk we will describe some of the
  recent developments in approximation algorithms for graph routing problem
 s\, and highlight some connections between this area and graph theory.

 atic society operates. They secure all kinds of traditional transactions 
  such as payments\, asset transfers\, titling  in the exact order in w
 hich they occur\, and enable totally new transactions  such as cryptocur
 rencies and smart contracts. They can remove intermediaries and usher in a
  new paradigm for trust. As currently implemented\, however\, public ledge
 rs cannot achieve their enormous potential.

DESCRIPTION:From Hopf Algebras to Machine learning via Rough Paths\nTerry 
 Lyons\, Oxford University\n\nRough path theory aims to build an effective 
 calculus that can model the interactions between complex oscillatory (roug
 h) evolving systems. At its mathematical foundations\, it is a combination
  of analysis blended with algebra that goes back to LC Young\, and to KT C
 hen. Key to the theory is the essential need to incorporate additional non
 -commutative structure into areas of mathematics we thought were stable. A
 t its high points\, there are the regularity structures of Martin Hairer t
 hat allow robust meaning to be given to numerous core nonlinear stochastic
  pdes describing evolving interfaces in physics.
