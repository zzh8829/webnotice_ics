DESCRIPTION:Number Theory in Function Fields\nWentang Kuo\, Department of 
 Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\n\nNumber theory is a branch of 
 pure mathematics devoted\nprimarily to the study of the integers. Integers
  can be\nconsidered either in themselves\, such as properties of\nprime nu
 mbers\, or as solutions to equations. The quotient\nfield of the ring of p
 olynomials is called the rational function\nfield. As the ring of polynomi
 als over a finite field shares\nsimilar arithmetic properties to the ring 
 of integers\,\nmany problems in integers have analogues for polynomials.\n
 In this talk\, we will use Fermat's last theorem and the\nprime number the
 orem as examples to discuss their analogues\nin polynomials. Also\, in spi
 te of similarities between rational\nnumbers and the rational function fie
 ld\, we will talk about\ndifferences and difficulties arising from problem
 s in these\ntwo settings.

DESCRIPTION:Contact Representation of Planar Graphs in 2D and 3D\nStephen 
 Kobourov\, Department of Computer Science\, University of Arizona\n\nIn a 
 proportional contact representation of a planar graph\, each vertex is rep
 resented by a simple polygon with area proportional to a given weight\, an
 d edges are represented by adjacencies between the corresponding pairs of 
 polygons. We show how to use Schnyder realizers and canonical orders for p
 lanar graphs to obtain different types of contact representations. Specifi
 cally\, we describe an algorithm that constructs proportional contact repr
 esentation for arbitrary planar graphs using 10-sided rectilinear polygons
 . We also describe a construction with 8-sided polygons\, which is optimal
  in terms of polygonal complexity\, as 8-sided polygons are sometimes nece
 ssary. In 3D vertices are represented by polytopes and edges by contacts b
 etween the corresponding polytopes contacts. We show that planar 3-trees h
 ave contact representations with cubes and proportional contact representa
 tions with boxes.

DESCRIPTION:Momentum and Position Forms\nJonathan Herman\, Department of P
 ure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\n\nWe first recall the theory of 
 the classical momentum and position functions on the phase space of a mani
 fold. The Poisson bracket relations between these functions form the bridg
 ing gap from classical to quantum mechanics. We extend the Poisson bracket
  to multisymplectic geometry and show that a more general relationship hol
 ds between 'momentum and position forms' on an $n$-plectic manifold.

 ment of Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\n\nEven though both redu
 cibilities seemed to behave in a similar way\, we could see (without proof
 )\, that they differ at how they get affected by adding a constant to the 
 structures. We give a proof this time and also show in another result that
  the difference is more than just the reactions to adding constants. The l
 atter result will require a version of the Slaman-Wehner structure.

DESCRIPTION:DBMS as a Bioinformatics Application Platform\nEvguenia Eflov\
 , David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science\n\nWith recent advancements
  in technology\, bioinformatics applications have to process and manage co
 nstantly growing amounts of data. Applications developed for a single proc
 essing node may not be sufficient to handle the demands of the current dat
 a volume. Several processing frameworks that aim to overcome the limitatio
 ns of a single computer have been proposed and used\, with MapReduce\, MPI
  and GPU-based being the most utilized. Of the three\, MapReduce is most f
 requently used in practice\; however\, there are limitations to usefulness
  of the framework\, most notably\, the required structure of the applicati
 on tasks executed in the framework.

 Hanson spaces\, Part II: Modifying the identification with the normal bund
 le\nSpiro Karigiannis\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, University of Wat
 erloo\n\nThis is the second in a series of talks\, where I will go through
  the details of my new construction with Dominic Joyce of smooth compact $
 G_2$~manifolds by glueing families of Eguchi-Hanson spaces. In fact\, this
  glueing involves three pieces\, rather than two\, and two of the three pi
 eces \\emph{do not} admit natural torsion-free $G_2$~structures\, which ma
 kes the construction much more complicated than the only other existing co
 nstructions\, by Joyce (1994) and by Kovalev/Corti-Haskins-Nordstr\\"om-Pa
 cini (2003/2012). In the second talk\, I will discuss both modifying the c
 onnection on the normal bundle and the exponential map\, in order to kill 
 the leading errors in the torsion on the middle glueing piece. If time per
 mits we will discuss the next major component of the construction\, namely
  the fibre-wise blow up of the orbifold to obtain a family of topologicall
 y Eguchi-Hanson spaces.

DESCRIPTION:Summer heat overwinters in the Arctic Ocean\nProfessor Mary-Lo
 uise Timmermans\, Yale University\n\nThe talk will address the implication
 s of a warming Arctic Ocean on the overlying sea-ice\ncover. In recent yea
 rs\, atypically warm water layers have been observed at depth in the\nArct
 ic Ocean. These derive from intense summertime solar heating in expansive 
 ice-free\nregions. Heat that is stored in the shallow ocean can be release
 d in the fall and winter by\nshear-driven mixing\, and convective mixing b
 y the release of dense plumes during sea-ice\ngrowth\, reducing the net se
 a-ice growth. On the other hand\, deeper warm ocean layers\nremain unaffec
 ted. I'll show that under continued warming\, there exists the possibility
  for a\nregime shift in ocean ventilation by these warm waters\, and a sub
 sequent cap on the storage\nof deep-ocean heat.

 the intersection of a line and an (extended) polymatroid in dimension n. W
 hen the direction of the line is nonnegative\, the problem is well-underst
 ood and the Discrete Newton method will require at most n trials. For gene
 ral directions\, however\, no bound (depending only on the dimension) was 
 known and we provide a quadratic upper bound. The analysis relies on sever
 al extremal results\, such as the length of the longest chain of ring fami
 lies (closed under intersection and union) or the length of the longest ge
 ometrically increasing sequence of values for a submodular function.

DESCRIPTION:On the Theory and Application of Early Warning Signals for Cri
 tical Transitions\nTom Bury\, Department of Applied Mathematics\n\nAbrupt 
 and often irreversible transitions can be observed in a wide variety of sy
 stems including ecological communities\, complex disease and social networ
 ks. These so-called 'critical transitions' can be brought on by a gradual 
 change in external conditions that quietly reduce the resilience of a syst
 em. Despite their seemingly unpredictable nature\, generic early warning s
 ignals have been proposed which\, once verified for a particular system\, 
 could provide the means for mitigating or even preventing unwanted transit
 ions. However\, in higher dimensions\, the typical early warning signals c
 an become amplified\, muted\, or even reversed\, due to the intricate vari
 able interactions in the approach to the transition. In addition\, these m
 ore complex systems can exhibit a wider variety of transitions to their si
 mplified counterparts. This thesis aims to pin down the mechanisms that ca
 use these particular alterations in early warning signals\, which may then
  work in our favour by helping us characterise the transition being approa
 ched. Working alongside models in the social\, ecological and biological s
 ciences\, we hope to contribute the the challenging task of detecting near
 by critical transitions in these fields.

 rom the pair $(E(G)\,r)$\, which is an example of a $2$-polymatroid\, one 
 can detemine $G$ up to isolated vertices and one can recognize matchings i
 n $G$. The cycle matroid in $G$ does not allow the determination of either
  of these things. Loosely speaking\, a $2$-polymatroid is like a matroid e

 , Louisiana State University\n\n"If a theorem about graphs can be expresse
 d in terms of edges and circuits only it probably exemplifies a more gener
 al theorem about matroids". Bill Tutte wrote these words in a commentary o
 n his 1966 paper 'Connectivity in matroids'. Indeed\, he went on to write 
 that a "belief in this general principle" led him to seek a matroid genera
 lization of his 1961 theorem that distinguishes the special role that whee
 ls play among 3-connected graphs. Because of the impossibility of doing ju
 stice to all of Bill's mathematical contributions in a single colloquium\,
  this talk will concentrate on those contributions that lie on the interfa
 ce between graph theory and matroid theory.
