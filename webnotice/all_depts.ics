DESCRIPTION:Number Theory in Function Fields\nWentang Kuo\, Department of 
 Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\nNumber theory is a branch of pu
 re mathematics devoted\nprimarily to the study of the integers. Integers c
 an be\nconsidered either in themselves\, such as properties of\nprime numb
 ers\, or as solutions to equations. The quotient\nfield of the ring of pol
 ynomials is called the rational function\nfield. As the ring of polynomial
 s over a finite field shares\nsimilar arithmetic properties to the ring of
  integers\,\nmany problems in integers have analogues for polynomials.\nIn
  this talk\, we will use Fermat's last theorem and the\nprime number theor
 em as examples to discuss their analogues\nin polynomials. Also\, in spite
  of similarities between rational\nnumbers and the rational function field
 \, we will talk about\ndifferences and difficulties arising from problems 
 in these\ntwo settings.

DESCRIPTION:Contact Representation of Planar Graphs in 2D and 3D\nStephen 
 Kobourov\, Department of Computer Science\, University of Arizona\nIn a pr
 oportional contact representation of a planar graph\, each vertex is repre
 sented by a simple polygon with area proportional to a given weight\, and 
 edges are represented by adjacencies between the corresponding pairs of po
 lygons. We show how to use Schnyder realizers and canonical orders for pla
 nar graphs to obtain different types of contact representations. Specifica
 lly\, we describe an algorithm that constructs proportional contact repres
 entation for arbitrary planar graphs using 10-sided rectilinear polygons. 
 We also describe a construction with 8-sided polygons\, which is optimal i
 n terms of polygonal complexity\, as 8-sided polygons are sometimes necess
 ary. In 3D vertices are represented by polytopes and edges by contacts bet
 ween the corresponding polytopes contacts. We show that planar 3-trees hav
 e contact representations with cubes and proportional contact representati
 ons with boxes.

 ure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\nWe first recall the theory of th
 e classical momentum and position functions on the phase space of a manifo
 ld. The Poisson bracket relations between these functions form the bridgin
 g gap from classical to quantum mechanics. We extend the Poisson bracket t
 o multisymplectic geometry and show that a more general relationship holds
  between 'momentum and position forms' on an $n$-plectic manifold.

 bilities seemed to behave in a similar way\, we could see (without proof)\
 , that they differ at how they get affected by adding a constant to the st
 ructures. We give a proof this time and also show in another result that t
 he difference is more than just the reactions to adding constants. The lat

 n technology\, bioinformatics applications have to process and manage cons
 tantly growing amounts of data. Applications developed for a single proces
 sing node may not be sufficient to handle the demands of the current data 
 volume. Several processing frameworks that aim to overcome the limitations
  of a single computer have been proposed and used\, with MapReduce\, MPI a
 nd GPU-based being the most utilized. Of the three\, MapReduce is most fre
 quently used in practice\; however\, there are limitations to usefulness o
 f the framework\, most notably\, the required structure of the application
  tasks executed in the framework.

 Hanson spaces\, Part II: Modifying the identification with the normal bund
 le\nSpiro Karigiannis\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, University of Wat
 erloo\nThis is the second in a series of talks\, where I will go through t
 he details of my new construction with Dominic Joyce of smooth compact $G_
 2$~manifolds by glueing families of Eguchi-Hanson spaces. In fact\, this g
 lueing involves three pieces\, rather than two\, and two of the three piec
 es \\emph{do not} admit natural torsion-free $G_2$~structures\, which make
 s the construction much more complicated than the only other existing cons
 tructions\, by Joyce (1994) and by Kovalev/Corti-Haskins-Nordstr\\"om-Paci
 ni (2003/2012). In the second talk\, I will discuss both modifying the con
 nection on the normal bundle and the exponential map\, in order to kill th
 e leading errors in the torsion on the middle glueing piece. If time permi
 ts we will discuss the next major component of the construction\, namely t
 he fibre-wise blow up of the orbifold to obtain a family of topologically 
 Eguchi-Hanson spaces.

DESCRIPTION:Summer heat overwinters in the Arctic Ocean\nProfessor Mary-Lo
 uise Timmermans\, Yale University\nThe talk will address the implications 
 of a warming Arctic Ocean on the overlying sea-ice\ncover. In recent years
 \, atypically warm water layers have been observed at depth in the\nArctic
  Ocean. These derive from intense summertime solar heating in expansive ic
 e-free\nregions. Heat that is stored in the shallow ocean can be released 
 in the fall and winter by\nshear-driven mixing\, and convective mixing by 
 the release of dense plumes during sea-ice\ngrowth\, reducing the net sea-
 ice growth. On the other hand\, deeper warm ocean layers\nremain unaffecte
 d. I'll show that under continued warming\, there exists the possibility f
 or a\nregime shift in ocean ventilation by these warm waters\, and a subse
 quent cap on the storage\nof deep-ocean heat.

 n the direction of the line is nonnegative\, the problem is well-understoo
 d and the Discrete Newton method will require at most n trials. For genera
 l directions\, however\, no bound (depending only on the dimension) was kn
 own and we provide a quadratic upper bound. The analysis relies on several
  extremal results\, such as the length of the longest chain of ring famili
 es (closed under intersection and union) or the length of the longest geom
 etrically increasing sequence of values for a submodular function.

DESCRIPTION:On the Theory and Application of Early Warning Signals for Cri
 tical Transitions\nTom Bury\, Department of Applied Mathematics\nAbrupt an
 d often irreversible transitions can be observed in a wide variety of syst
 ems including ecological communities\, complex disease and social networks
 . These so-called 'critical transitions' can be brought on by a gradual ch
 ange in external conditions that quietly reduce the resilience of a system
 . Despite their seemingly unpredictable nature\, generic early warning sig
 nals have been proposed which\, once verified for a particular system\, co
 uld provide the means for mitigating or even preventing unwanted transitio
 ns. However\, in higher dimensions\, the typical early warning signals can
  become amplified\, muted\, or even reversed\, due to the intricate variab
 le interactions in the approach to the transition. In addition\, these mor
 e complex systems can exhibit a wider variety of transitions to their simp
 lified counterparts. This thesis aims to pin down the mechanisms that caus
 e these particular alterations in early warning signals\, which may then w
 ork in our favour by helping us characterise the transition being approach
 ed. Working alongside models in the social\, ecological and biological sci
 ences\, we hope to contribute the the challenging task of detecting nearby
  critical transitions in these fields.

 , Louisiana State University\n"If a theorem about graphs can be expressed 
 in terms of edges and circuits only it probably exemplifies a more general
  theorem about matroids". Bill Tutte wrote these words in a commentary on 
 his 1966 paper 'Connectivity in matroids'. Indeed\, he went on to write th
 at a "belief in this general principle" led him to seek a matroid generali
 zation of his 1961 theorem that distinguishes the special role that wheels
  play among 3-connected graphs. Because of the impossibility of doing just
 ice to all of Bill's mathematical contributions in a single colloquium\, t
 his talk will concentrate on those contributions that lie on the interface
  between graph theory and matroid theory.
