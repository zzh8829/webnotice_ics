DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Jilles Vreeken\, Max Planck Institute for Informatic
 s and Saarland University\nTitle:   "Causal Inference by Compression" \n\n
 Remarks:  Refreshments will be provided  \n\nAbstract:  Determining cause 
 from effect is perhaps the most fundamental problem in science. We are int
 erested in inferring the most likely direction between two random variable
 s X and Y given only observational data over their joint distribution. Tha
 t is\, we want to identify whether X causes Y \, whether Y causes X\, or w
 hether they are merely correlated. Traditional methods\, that rely on cond
 itional independence tests\, cannot decide between the Markov equivalent c
 lasses of X -> Y and Y -> X. We hence take a different approach\, based on
  information theory.\n In particular\, we base our approach on the algorit
 hmic Markov condition\, that states that if X causes Y \, the factorizatio
 n of the joint distribution P(X\, Y) in the causal direction has a simpler
  description---in terms of Kolmogorov complexity---than that in the anti-c
 ausal direction. That is\, if X -> Y \, K(P(X)) + K(P(Y | X)) < K(P(Y)) + 
 K(P(X | Y)). Loosely speaking\, we identify the most likely causal directi
 on as the one in which we can best compress the data. As any physical proc
 ess can be modelled by a Turing machine\, this ideal score can detect any 
 causal dependence that can be explained by a physical process. However\, K
 olmogorov complexity is not computable\, so we need practical instantiatio
 ns of this ideal. We do so using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) prin
 ciple\, which provides a statistically well-founded approximation of Kolmo
 gorov complexity.\n In this talk I will discuss three techniques\, one for
  pairs of univariate numeric variabes\, one for univariate discrete variab
 les\, and one for multivariate mixed type variables\, and show that these 
 perform very well in practice---and\, hopefully convince you that this inf
 ormation theoretic approach to causal inference is not just interesting\, 
 but also promising.  \n \n \n

   We consider PAC learning of probability distributions (a.k.a. density es
 timation)\, where we are given an i.i.d. sample generated from an unknown 
 target distribution\, and want to output a distribution that is close to t
 he target in total variation distance. Let F be an arbitrary class of prob
 ability distributions\, and let F^k denote the class of k-mixtures of elem
 ents of F. Assuming the existence of a method for learning F in the realiz
 able setting\, we provide a method for learning F^k in the agnostic settin
 g. Furthermore\, roughly speaking\, we show that the sample complexity inc
 reases at most by a factor of {k}/{\\epsilon^2}. \n We provide two applica
 tions of our main result. First\, we show that the class of mixtures of k 
 axis-aligned Gaussians in d-dimensional Euclidean space is PAC-learnable i
 n the agnostic setting with sample complexity O({kd}/{\\epsilon ^ 4}) whic
 h is tight in k and d. Second\, we show that the class of mixtures of k Ga
 ussians is PAC-learnable in the agnostic setting with sample complexity O(
 {kd^2}/{\\epsilon ^ 4})\, which improves the previous known bounds in its 
 dependence on k and d. \n This is joint work with Abbas Mehrabian and Shai

  is generally not helpful.  We need a way to make sense of information by 
 determining which part of it is the most important for a given application
 .  There are numerous mathematical methods which can be used to extract fe
 atures from a dataset.  In this talk we will use wavelet and empirical ort
 hogonal function (EOF) methods to examine in situ measurements from Honeoy
 e Lake in upstate New York.   These two methods identify features on diffe
 rent timescales.  We will then show how EOFs can be used to represent the 
 original data by a simple reduced order model.  This model\, while having 
 half the dimension of the original data\, retains enough information to ac
 curately construct the time series for the Wedderburn number and the Schmi
 dt Stability Index with a small RMS error.   The more general problem\, al
 ong with possible directions for future work\, will then be discussed.  \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Ian Payne\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, Univers
 ity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "2-Semilattices: Residual Properties and Applica
 tions to Constraint Satisfaction Problems" \n\nAbstract:  Semilattices are
  algebras known to have an important connection to partially ordered sets.
  In particular\, if a partially ordered set $(A\,\\leq)$ has greatest lowe
 r bounds\, a semilattice $(A\;\\wedge)$ can be associated to the order whe
 re $a\\wedge b$ is the greatest lower bound of $a$ and $b$. In this thesis
 \, we study a class of algebras known as $2$-semilattices\, which is a gen
 eralization of the class of semilattices. Similar to the correspondence be
 tween partial orders and semilattices\, there is a correspondence between 
 certain digraphs and $2$-semilattices. That is\, to every $2$-semilattice\
 , there is an associated digraph which holds information about the $2$-sem
 ilattice. Making frequent use of this correspondence\, we explore the clas
 s of $2$-semilattices from three perspectives: (i) Tame Congruence Theory\
 , (ii) the "residual character" of the class of $2$-semilattices\, and (ii
 i)\, the constraint satisfaction problem.\n Tame Congruence Theory\, devel
 oped by Hobby and McKenzie\, is a structure theory on finite algebras driv
 en by understanding prime congruence quotients of finite algebras. The the
 ory assigns to each such quotient a type from {\\bf 1} to {\\bf 5}. We sho
 w that types {\\bf 3}\, {\\bf 4}\, and {\\bf 5} can occur in the class of 
 $2$-semilattices\, but type {\\bf 4} can not occur in a finite simple $2$-
 semilattice.\n Classes of algebras contain "irreducible" members which hol
 d information about the class. Specifically\, the size of the irreducible 
 members has been of interest to many authors. We show for certain subclass
 es of the class of $2$-semilattices that there is no cardinal bound on the
  size of the irreducible members in that subclass.\n The "fixed template c
 onstraint satisfaction problem" can be identified with the decision proble
 m hom$(\\mathbb{A})$ where $\\mathbb{A}$ is a fixed finite relational stru
 cture. The input to hom$(\\mathbb{A})$ is a finite structure $\\mathbb{B}$
  similar to $\\mathbb{A}$. The question asked is "does there exist a homom
 orphism from $\\mathbb{B}$ to $\\mathbb{A}$?" Feder and Vardi conjectured 
 that for fixed $\\mathbb{A}$\, this decision problem is either {\\bf NP}-c
 omplete or solvable in polynomial time. Bulatov confirmed this conjecture 
 in the case that $\\mathbb{A}$ is invariant under a $2$-semilattice operat
 ion. We extend this result.  \n \n \n

  Lemma\, a cornerstone of the probabilistic method\, is a powerful and wid
 ely used proof technique. In 2009\, Moser introduced a technique called en
 tropy compression to provide efficient algorithms which construct objects 
 that the Local Lemma guarantees to exist. Recently\, entropy compression h
 as been used to develop more powerful versions of the Local Lemma which pr
 ovide existence proofs in settings where the original Local Lemma does not
  apply. I will illustrate this technique with applications to graph colour

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Shawn Corvec\, Department of Applied Mathematics\, U
 niversity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "A modelling investigation into the impact
 s of the convective parameterization on the tropical circulation" \n\nAbst
 ract:  Many studies have shown that the tropical circulations (Walker and 
 Hadley circulations) will weaken in a warmer world. This is sometimes attr
 ibuted to changes in the tropical mean water cycling rate (driven by conve
 ctive mass flux)\, which does not increase as fast as boundary layer water
  vapour in the tropics. However\, this theory is only valid for the large 
 scale upward convective mass flux in the tropics\, not necessarily to the 
 local circulations\, which are not as energetically constrained. Here\, we
  show that there is also a potential regime in which this argument does no
 t hold by simply changing the convective scheme in a climate model. This r
 egime is one in which the tropical mean convective mass flux can actually 
 increase with warming\, provided the precipitation efficiency decreases si
 gnificantly. Our work supports the theory that the uniform tropical mean s
 tatic stability increase is the physical driver of the weakening of the tr
 opical circulations with climate change\, which is mainly driven by the tr
 opical mean SST increase\, regardless of the change in strength of convect
 ive mass flux. The local changes in tropospheric diabatic heating from hea
 ting are shown to influence the magnitude of the weakening of the Walker c
 irculation.\n We find that the precipitation efficiency decreases in an in
 creased sea surface temperature AMIP-type experiment using the CAM4 AGCM w
 ith an alternate convective scheme using a unique mass flux closure\, lead
 ing to a plausible scenario where tropical mean convective mass flux may i
 ncrease\, while the large-scale tropical circulations still weaken. While 
 large-scale upward motion and convective mass flux are closely correlated 
 spatially\, the nature of this relationship can change in a warmer world i
 f the precipitation efficiency changes. A decrease in precipitation effici
 ency can allow for increased upward convective mass flux\, but the same tr
 opospheric heating rate response\, as the increased rate of condensational
  heating is offset by increased evaporational cooling. A decrease in preci
 pitation efficiency leads to a lower heating rate per unit of upward mass 
 flux due to a compensating increase in evaporation. The large tropical mea
 n evaporation response seen with this scheme allows for stronger tropical 
 mean convective updrafts\, especially of the shallow variety\, to balance 
 where the evaporational cooling response is maximized.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Mikhai Panine\, Department of Applied Mathematics\, 
 University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "On Perturbative Methods in Spectral Geom
 etry" \n\nAbstract:  The goal of spectral geometry is to establish how muc
 h information about the geometry of compact Riemannian manifolds is contai
 ned in the spectra of natural differential operators\, especially Laplacia
 ns\, defined on them. Ideally\, one would like to be able to recover the R
 iemannian manifold\, up to isometry\, from the spectra of one or several s
 uch operators. This would be a very powerful result\, as it would introduc
 e an invariant way to describe the shape of Riemannian manifolds. The cons
 equences of such a result would range from practical applications to shape
  recognition to theoretical insights into quantum gravity.\n However\, the
  most general form of such statements is known to be false. There is a num
 ber of known counterexamples\, that is isospectral but not isometric manif
 olds. Indeed\, there are even techniques to construct such counterexamples
 . Nonetheless\, it is believed that almost all Riemannian manifolds can be
  identified by their spectra. In other words\, the counterexamples are exp
 ected to be exceedingly rare special cases. This has been shown to be the 
 case in some restricted classes of manifolds. The proof in the general cas
 e has remained elusive.\n The main goal of this thesis is to move towards 
 such a proof by studying the structure of isospectral sets of metrics. The
  main tool we use for this purpose is perturbation theory\, a method ubiqu
 itous in physics\, but strangely underused in spectral geometry. Consequen
 tly\, a secondary goal of this work is to demonstrate the usefulness of pe
 rturbation theory to the study of spectral geometry. We begin by a numeric
 al exploration of spectral geometry in a perturbative regime. Then\, we sh
 ow that sets of isospectral conformally equivalent metrics on boundaryless
  manifolds of dimension two contain no convex subsets. This is an entirely
  new type of result in spectral geometry. We argue that it could lead to a
  proof of the rarity of counterexamples to the program of identifying shap
 es by their spectra.\n The thesis also includes reviews of the fundamental
 s of the spectral theory of Laplace-type operators\, of major results in s
 pectral geometry and of perturbation theory.  \n \n \n

  Science\nTitle:   "Restricted String Representations" \n\nAbstract:  A st
 ring representation of a graph assigns to every vertex a curve in the plan
 e so that two curves intersect if and only if the represented vertices are
  adjacent. This work investigates string representations of graphs with an
  emphasis on the shapes of curves and the way they  intersect. We strength
 en some previously known results and show that every planar graph has stri
 ng representations where every curve consists of axis-parallel line segmen
 ts with at most two bends (those are the so-called  $B_2$-VPG representati
 ons) and simultaneously two curves intersect each other at most once (thos
 e are the so-called 1-string representations). Thus\, planar graphs are $B
 _2$-VPG $1$-string graphs.  \n We further show that with some restrictions
  on the shapes of the curves\, string representations can be used to produ
 ce approximation algorithms for several hard problems. The $B_2$-VPG repre
 sentations of planar graphs satisfy these restrictions. We attempt to furt
 her restrict the number of bends in VPG representations for subclasses of 
 planar graphs\, and investigate $B_1$-VPG representations. \n We propose  
 new classes of string representations for planar graphs that we call "orde
 r-preserving.'' Order-preservation is an interesting property that relates
  the string representation to the planar embedding of the graph\, and we b
 elieve that it might prove useful when constructing string representations
 . Finally\, we extend our investigation of string representations to strin
 g representations that require some curves to intersect multiple times. We
  show that there are outer-string graphs that require an exponential numbe
 r of crossings in their outer-string representations. Our construction als
 o proves that 1-planar graphs\, i.e.\, graphs that are no longer planar\, 
 yet fairly close to planar graphs\, may have string representations\, but 
 they are not always 1-string.  \n \n \n

 e\nTitle:   "Scalable and Holistic Qualitative Data Cleaning" \n\nAbstract
 :  Data quality is one of the most important problems in data management\,
  since dirty data often leads to inaccurate data analytics results and wro
 ng business decisions. Poor data across businesses and the government cost
  the U.S. economy $3.1 trillion a year\, according to a report by InsightS
 quared in 2012. Data scientists reportedly spend 60% of their time in clea
 ning and organizing the data according to a survey published in Forbes in 
 2016. Therefore\, we need to design effective and efficient techniques to 
 reduce the human efforts in data cleaning.\n Data cleaning activities usua
 lly consist of two phases: error detection and error repair. Error detecti
 on techniques can generally be classified as either quantitative or qualit
 ative. Quantitative error detection techniques often involve statistical a
 nd machine learning methods to identify abnormal behaviors and errors. Qua
 ntitative error detection techniques have been mostly studied in the conte
 xt of outlier detection. Qualitative error detection techniques rely on de
 scriptive approaches to specify patterns or constraints of a legal data in
 stance. One common way of specifying those patterns or constraints is by u
 sing data quality rules. Qualitative error detection techniques based on d
 ata quality rules capture errors by identifying violations of the specifie
 d rules. This dissertation focuses on tackling the challenges associated w
 ith detecting and repairing qualitative errors.\n To clean a dirty dataset
  using rule-based qualitative data cleaning techniques\, we first need to 
 design data quality rules that reflect the semantics of the data. One way 
 to obtain data quality rules is by consulting domain experts\, which requi
 res a lot of domain expertise and is usually a time-consuming processing. 
 Therefore\, we need automatic techniques to discover data quality rules. W
 e show how to mine data quality rules expressed in the formalism of denial
  constraints (DCs). We choose DCs as the formal language for capturing dat
 a quality rules because it is able to capture many real-life data quality 
 rules\, and at the same time it allows for efficient discovery algorithm\,
  as we will show in this dissertation.\n In detecting qualitative errors\,
  we tackle the scalability challenges associated with it\, as error detect
 ion often requires a tuple pairwise comparison\, a quadratic complexity th
 at is expensive for a large dataset. We present a distribution strategy th
 at distributes the error detection workload evenly to a cluster of machine

 ution strategy aims at minimizing the maximum computation cost and the max
 imum communication cost across all machines\, which are the two main types
  of cost one needs to consider in a shared-nothing environment.\n In repai

 o Model Sentiment Dynamics in Event-based Text" \n\nAbstract:  Natural lan
 guage texts are often meant to express or impact individuals emotions. S
 entiment analysis researchers are increasingly interested in investigating
  natural language processing techniques as well as emotions theories to cl
 assify sentiments expressed in natural language text. Most sentiment analy
 sis research effort focuses on classifying highly opinionated documents fr
 om the writer's perspectives and uses either count-based word representati
 ons that ignore sentence structure or a small set of lexicon resources tha
 t do not cover the wide range of words used on the Internet. \n In this th
 esis\, we propose a cross-disciplinary approach that incorporates Affect C
 ontrol Theory (ACT) into a structured model to determine three-dimensional
  sentiment polarity of event-based articles from the readers and interac
 tants perspectives. ACT is a socio-mathematical theory that models human
 s' sentiment towards social events in a three-dimensional space and estima
 tes the situational post-event sentiment by considering the interaction be
 tween these sentiments. \n We develop an algorithm that performs a fine-gr
 ained events extraction from English sentences using a combination of sema
 ntic and syntactic parsing techniques. We also augment an ACT three-dimens
 ional lexicon in a semi-supervised fashion using a graph-based label propa
 gation method built upon semantic and distributed word representations. Us
 ing the extracted events\, the augmented lexicon\, and the ACT mathematica
 l equations\, we propose an entity-based sentiment analysis approach that 
 models the readers triggered emotions from event-based sentences toward 
 the events and their associated entities. We also propose an ACT-based mod
 el to predict the temporal progression of the interactants emotions and 
 their optimal behaviour (acts) over a sequence of interactions. We evaluat
 e the first approach on a manually annotated news headline corpus and the 
 second on three different types of corpora: fairy tales\, news articles\, 
 and a hand-crafted corpus. \n The results demonstrate that\, despite the c
 hallenging structure of the sentences\, there was a reasonable agreement b
 etween the estimated emotions and behaviours and their corresponding groun
 d truths.  \n \n \n

 lysia bag cell network" \n\nAbstract:  The Aplysia bag cell neuron serves 
 as an ideal model for dynamical switching in persistent neural systems. Pe
 rsistent neural systems can exhibit long-term responses to stimulus\, \nof
 ten switching from the traditional excitable\, steady-state dynamics to a 
 period of re- \npeated spiking or bursting. In Aplysia\, such behavior\, k
 nown as the afterdischarge\, is exhibited by the bag cell neuron and regul
 ated by second messenger calcium dynamics. \nA model is constructed based 
 on experimental data that includes many qualitative fea- \ntures of the Ap
 lysia bag cell electrophysiology\, including use-dependence\, non-selectiv
 e cation channels\, calcium persistence\, all of which contribute to after
 discharge dynamics. Several methods are used to fit experimental data and 
 construct the model\, including hand tuning\, parameter forcing\, genetic 
 algorithms\, and continuation analysis in an effort to overcome degeneracy
 \, sensitivity\, and other barriers to complex model construction. Once th
 e neuron model is established\, a diffusively-coupled network model is con
 structed to simulate the electrical coupling observed in bag cell clusters
  in nature. A simple two-neuron network reproduces some experimental resul
 ts and larger networks are considered. Little is known about the topology 
 of Aplysia bag cell neurons. The final chapter of this thesis explores dif
 ferent topologies in a 100-neuron network\, exploring how the coupling con
 stant\, topology\, and size of the network affects the networks ability 
 to synchronize.  \n \n \n

 lems" \n\nAbstract:  Smith normal form is a diagonalization of matrices wi
 th many applications in diophantine analysis\, graph theory\, system contr
 ol theory\, simplified homology\, and\, more recently\, in topographic dat
 a analysis of big data. Efficient computation of Smith form is a well-stud
 ied area for matrices with integer and polynomial entries. Existing succes
 sful algorithms typically rely on elimination for dense matrices and itera
 tive Krylov space methods for sparse matrices.\n Our interest lies in comp
 uting Smith normal form for sparse matrices over local rings\, where tradi
 tional iterative methods face challenges due to the lack of unique minimal
  polynomials. We explore different approaches to tackling this problem for
  two local rings: integers modulo prime powers\, and polynomials modulo po
 wer of an irreducible element. Over local polynomial rings\, we find succe
 ss in linearization into larger dimension matrices over the base field. Ef
 fectively\, we transform the problem of computing Smith normal form into a
  small number of rank problems over the base field. The latter problem has
  existing efficient algorithms.\n The problem is harder over local integer
  rings. We take the approach of hybrid sparse-dense algorithms. We also ta
 ckle a restricted version of the problem where we detect only the first no
 n-trivial invariant factor. We also give an algorithm to find the first fe
 w invariant factors using iterative rank-1 updates. This method becomes de
 nse when applied to finding all the invariant factors.\n We digress slight
 ly into the related problem of preconditioning. We show that linearization
  preconditions are suitable for computing Smith normal form\, and computin
 g nullspace samples. For the latter problem\, we design an algorithm for c
 omputing uniform samples from the nullspace.\n On a separate track\, we fo
 cus on the properties of the Smith normal form decomposition. We relate th
 e invariant factors to eigenvalues. Our ultimate goal is to extend the app
 lications of numerical algorithms for computing eigenvalues to computing t
 he invariant factors of symbolic matrices.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Kexue Zhang\, Department of Applied Mathematics\, Un

 n\nAbstract:  Dynamical networks (DNs) consist of a large set of interconn
 ected nodes with each node being a fundamental unit with detailed contents
 . A great number of natural and man-made networks such as social networks\
 , food networks\, neural networks\, the Work Wide Web\, elec-trical power 
 grid\, etc.\, can be effectively modeled by DNs. The main focus of the pre
 sent thesis is on delay-dependent impulsive control of DNs. To study the i
 mpulsive control problem of DNs\, we ﬁrstly construct stability results 
 for general nonlinear time-delay systems with de-layed impulses by using t
 he method of Lyapunov functionals and Razumikhin technique.\nSecondly\, we
  study the consensus problem of multi-agent systems with both ﬁxed and s
 witching topologies. A hybrid consensus protocol is proposed to take into 
 consideration of continuous-time communications among agents and delayed i
 nstant information exchanges on a sequence of discrete times. Then\, a nov
 el hybrid consensus protocol with dynamically changing interaction topolog
 ies is designed to take the time-delay into account in both the continuous
 -time communication among agents and the instant information exchange at d
 is-crete moments. We also study the consensus problem of networked multi-a
 gent systems. Dis-tributed delays are considered in both the agent dynamic
 s and the proposed impulsive consen-sus protocols.\nLastly\, stabilization
  and synchronization problems of DNs under pinning impulsive control are s
 tudied. A pinning algorithm is incorporated with the impulsive control met
 hod. We pro-pose a delay-dependent pinning impulsive controller to investi
 gate the synchronization of lin-ear delay-free DNs on time scales. Then\, 
 we apply the pinning impulsive controller proposed for the delay-free netw
 orks to stabilize time-delay DNs. Results show that the delay-dependent pi
 nning impulsive controller can successfully stabilize and synchronize DNs 
 with/without time-delay. Moreover\, we design a type of pinning impulsive 
 controllers that relies only on the network states at history moments (not
  on the states at each impulsive instant). Sufﬁ-cient conditions on stab
 ilization of time-delay networks are obtained\, and results show that the 
 proposed pinning impulsive controller can effectively stabilize the networ
 k even though only time-delay states are available to the pinning controll
 er at each impulsive instant. We fur-ther consider the pinning impulsive c
 ontrollers with both discrete and distributed time-delay effects to synchr
 onize the drive and response systems modeled by globally Lipshitz time-del
 ay systems. As an extension study of pinning impulsive control approach\, 
 we investigate the synchronization problem of systems and networks governe
 d by PDEs.  \n \n \n

 cillators arise in a variety of areas. Clustering is a type of oscillatory
  network behavior where elements of a network segregate into groups. Eleme
 nts within a group oscillate synchronously\, while elements in different g
 roups oscillate with a fixed phase difference. In this thesis\, we study n
 etworks of N identical oscillators with time delayed\, global circulant co
 upling with two approaches.\n We first use the theory of weakly coupled os
 cillators to reduce the system \nof delay differential equations to a phas
 e model where the time delay \nenters as a phase shift.  We use the phase 
 model to determine\nmodel independent existence and stability results for 
 symmetric \ncluster solutions. We show that the presence of the time delay
  can lead to the coexistence of multiple stable clustering solutions.\n We
  then perform stability and bifurcation analysis to the original system of
  delay differential equations with symmetry. We first study the existence 
 of Hopf bifurcations induced by coupling time delay\, and then use symmetr
 ic Hopf bifurcation theory to determine how these bifurcations lead to dif
 ferent patterns of symmetric cluster oscillations. We apply our results to
  two specific examples: a network of FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons with diffusiv
 e coupling and a network of Morris-Lecar neurons with synaptic coupling. I
 n the case studies\, we show how time delays in the coupling between neuro
 ns can give rise to switching between different stable cluster solutions\,
  coexistence of multiple stable cluster solutions and solutions with multi
 ple frequencies.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Cătălin-Alexandru Avram\, David R. Cheriton School
  of Computer Science\nTitle:   "Geographically Distributed Database Manage
 ment at the Cloud's Edge" \n\nAbstract:  Request latency resulting from th
 e geographic separation between clients and remote application servers is 
 a challenge for cloud-hosted web and mobile applications. Numerous studies
  have shown the importance of low latency to the end user experience. Smal
 l response time increases on the order of a few hundred milliseconds direc
 tly translate to reduced user satisfaction and loss of revenue that persis
 t even after a low latency environment is restored. One way to address thi
 s challenge in geo-distributed settings is to push all or part of the appl
 ication\, along with the data it requires\, to the edge of the cloud  cl
 oser to application clients. My thesis explores the idea of taking advanta
 ge of clients' proximity to the edge of the network in order to reduce req
 uest latencies.\n SpearDB is a prototype replicated distributed database s
 ystem that operates in a star network topology\, with a core site and a la
 rge number of edge sites that are close to clients. Clients access the nea
 rest edge\, which holds replicas of locally relevant portions of the datab
 ase. SpearDB's edge sites coordinate through the core to provide a global 
 transactional consistency guarantee (parallel snapshot isolation or PSI)\,
  while handling as much work locally as possible. SpearDB provides full ge
 neral purpose transactional semantics with ACID guarantees. Experiments sh
 ow that SpearDB is effective at reducing workload latencies for applicatio
 ns whose access patterns are geographically localizable. Many applications
  fit this criteria: bulletin boards (e.g.\, Craigslist\, Kijiji)\, local c
 ommerce or services (e.g.\, Groupon\, Uber)\, booking and ticketing (e.g.\
 , OpenTable\, StubHub)\, location-based services (mapping\, directions\, a
 ugmented reality)\, local news outlets and client-centric services (e-mail
 \, rss feeds\, gaming). SpearDB introduces protocols for executing applica
 tion transactions in a geo-distributed setting under strong consistency gu
 arantees. These protocols automatically hide the complexity as well as muc
 h of the latency introduced by geo-distribution from applications.\n The e
 ffectiveness of SpearDB depends on the placement of primary and secondary 
 replicas at core and edge sites. The secondary replica placement problem i
 s shown to be NP-hard. Several algorithms for automatic data partitioning 
 and replication are presented to provide approximate solutions. These algo
 rithms work in a geo-distributed core-edge setting under partial replicati
 on. Their goal is to bring data closer to clients in order to lower reques
 t latencies. Experimental comparisons of the resulting placements' latency
  impact show good results. Surprisingly\, however\, the placements produce
 d by the simplest of the proposed algorithms are comparable in quality to 
 those produced by more complex approaches.  \n \n \n
