 "Risk Measures in a Quantile Regression Credibility Framework" \n\nRemarks
 :  Refreshments will be provided.  \n\nAbstract:  Here\, we extend the ide
 a of embedding the classical credibility model into risk measures\, as was
  presented by Pitselis (2016)\, to the idea of embedding regression credib
 ility into risk measures. The resulting credible regression risk measures 
 capture the risk of individual insurer's contract (in finance\, the indivi
 dual asset return portfolio) as well as the portfolio risk consisting of s
 everal similar but not identical contracts (in finance\, several similar p
 ortfolios of asset returns)\,  which are grouped together to share the ris
 k. In insurance\, credibility plays a special role of spreading the risk. 
 In financial terminology\, credibility plays a special role of diversifica
 tion of risk. For each model\, regression credibility models are establish
 ed  and  the robustness of these models is investigated. Applications to F
 ama/French financial portfolio data are also presented.  \n \n \n

 the effects of semantic relationships on human memory search. A variety of
  computational models have been proposed that explain human behavioral dat
 a\, yet it remains unclear how millions of spiking neurons work in unison 
 to realize the cognitive processes involved in memory search. \n In this t
 alk\, I will present a biologically constrained neural network model that 
 performs the task in a fashion similar to humans. The model reproduces exp
 erimentally observed response timing effects\, as well as similarity trend
 s within and across semantic categories derived from responses. Three diff
 erent sources of the association data have been tested by embedding associ
 ations in neural connections\, with free association norms providing the b
 est match.  \n \n \n

 gle-free graphs of arbitrarily large chromatic number\, in some contexts i
 t is possible to obtain better bounds on the chromatic number when triangl
 es are forbidden.  For example\, graphs of maximum degree Delta can\nhave 
 chromatic number up to Delta+1\, but triangle-free graphs of maximum degre
 e Delta have chromatic number O(Delta/log Delta).  In contrast\, there exi
 st d-degenerate triangle-free graphs that are not d-colorable (but all d-d
 egenerate graphs are (d+1)-colorable)\, showing that in this context\nforb
 idding triangles does not help.\n In a joint work with Ken-ichi Kawarabaya
 shi\, we recently proved that triangle-free graphs of tree-width t are cei
 l((t+3)/2)-colorable\, and this bound is tight.  In addition to this resul
 t\, I will outline connections to (non)approximability of chromatic number
  in proper minor-closed classes\, and\npropose further related problems.

  University\nTitle:   "Efficient Discrete Optimization for Binary Energies
  with Applications to Image Segmentation" \n\nRemarks:  Please note: This 
 is a SACA seminar.  \n\nAbstract:  Discrete optimization is a successful a
 pproach for numerous computer vision applications. The state of the art in
  several fundamental vision tasks  such as stereo correspondence\, image
  segmentation\, image stitching\, etc.  has been moved forward significa
 ntly due to the development of effective energy minimization techniques. A
  particularly useful class of energies comes from Markov Random Field (MRF
 ) or Conditional Random Field (CRF) models. Even with the recent revolutio
 n in the field due to deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\, CRF and 
 MRF models are still highly relevant. CNNs\, although excellent at learnin
 g image features\, do not model pixel dependencies and can produce results
  with noisy isolated regions. MRF/CRF models\, on the other hand\,  are ex
 cellent at obtaining  spatially coherent results. Therefore many CNN  mode
 ls whose goal is pixel-precise image labeling use CRFs for refining the ac
 curacy.\n The major difficulty of energy minimization framework is its hig
 h computational cost\, as many energies arising in practice are NP-hard to
  minimize. In this talk\, I will present several efficient methods for min
 imization of binary energies. Binary energies are an essential class to ha
 ndle\, as optimization of general energies can be reduced to the binary ca
 se. We have developed efficient algorithms for binary nonsubmodular energi
 es that are based on two different frameworks: Trust Region (TR) and Auxil
 iary Functions (AUX). The methods that we have developed significantly out
 perform the previously known state of the art on many applications. For ap
 plications such as image segmentation with convex shape prior and with cur
 vature regularization\, previously available methods fail completely\, whi
 le our methods achieve accurate results. \n      \n Bio : Ol

 d local search" \n\nAbstract:  Diversity maximization is an important conc
 ept in information retrieval\, computational geometry and operations resea
 rch. Usually\, it is a variant of the following problem: Given a ground se
 t\, constraints\, and a function f(⋅) that measures diversity of a subse
 t\, the task is to select a feasible subset S such that f(S) is maximized.
  The sum-dispersion function f(S) is the sum of the pairwise distances in 
 S\, is in this context a prominent diversification measure. The correspond
 ing diversity maximization is the max-sum or sum-sum diversification. Alre
 ady for one cardinality constraint\, max-sum diversification cannot be app
 roximated better than by a factor of 1/2 if the distances are metric.  We 
 present a PTAS for the max-sum diversification problem for distances d(⋅
 \,⋅) of negative type for various constraint settings\, including matroi
 d constraints and matroid intersection constraints. Distances of negative 
 type are\, for example\, metric distances stemming from the §¤2 and §¤
 1 norm\, as well as the cosine or spherical\, or Jaccard distance which ar
 e popular similarity metrics in web and image search. \n Joint work with A

  essentially optimal given Blais's non-adaptive junta tester\, which makes
  O(k^(3/2))/ϵ queries and shows that adaptivity enables polynomial savi
 ngs in query complexity for junta testing. At a very high level\, the proo
 f proceeds by reducing the non-adaptive junta testing of a new class of ra

 n\nAbstract:  We are overwhelmed with information\, but raw data by itself
  is generally not helpful.  We need a way to make sense of information by 
 determining which part of it is the most important for a given application
 .  There are numerous mathematical methods which can be used to extract fe
 atures from a dataset.  In this talk we will use wavelet and empirical ort
 hogonal function (EOF) methods to examine in situ measurements from Honeoy
 e Lake in upstate New York.   These two methods identify features on diffe
 rent timescales.  We will then show how EOFs can be used to represent the 
 original data by a simple reduced order model.  This model\, while having 
 half the dimension of the original data\, retains enough information to ac
 curately construct the time series for the Wedderburn number and the Schmi
 dt Stability Index with a small RMS error.   The more general problem\, al
 ong with possible directions for future work\, will then be discussed.  \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Mikhai Panine\, Department of Applied Mathematics\, 
 University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "On Perturbative Methods in Spectral Geom
 etry" \n\nAbstract:  The goal of spectral geometry is to establish how muc
 h information about the geometry of compact Riemannian manifolds is contai
 ned in the spectra of natural differential operators\, especially Laplacia
 ns\, defined on them. Ideally\, one would like to be able to recover the R
 iemannian manifold\, up to isometry\, from the spectra of one or several s
 uch operators. This would be a very powerful result\, as it would introduc
 e an invariant way to describe the shape of Riemannian manifolds. The cons
 equences of such a result would range from practical applications to shape
  recognition to theoretical insights into quantum gravity.\n However\, the
  most general form of such statements is known to be false. There is a num
 ber of known counterexamples\, that is isospectral but not isometric manif
 olds. Indeed\, there are even techniques to construct such counterexamples
 . Nonetheless\, it is believed that almost all Riemannian manifolds can be
  identified by their spectra. In other words\, the counterexamples are exp
 ected to be exceedingly rare special cases. This has been shown to be the 
 case in some restricted classes of manifolds. The proof in the general cas
 e has remained elusive.\n The main goal of this thesis is to move towards 
 such a proof by studying the structure of isospectral sets of metrics. The
  main tool we use for this purpose is perturbation theory\, a method ubiqu
 itous in physics\, but strangely underused in spectral geometry. Consequen
 tly\, a secondary goal of this work is to demonstrate the usefulness of pe
 rturbation theory to the study of spectral geometry. We begin by a numeric
 al exploration of spectral geometry in a perturbative regime. Then\, we sh
 ow that sets of isospectral conformally equivalent metrics on boundaryless
  manifolds of dimension two contain no convex subsets. This is an entirely
  new type of result in spectral geometry. We argue that it could lead to a
  proof of the rarity of counterexamples to the program of identifying shap
 es by their spectra.\n The thesis also includes reviews of the fundamental
 s of the spectral theory of Laplace-type operators\, of major results in s
 pectral geometry and of perturbation theory.  \n \n \n

 e\nTitle:   "Scalable and Holistic Qualitative Data Cleaning" \n\nAbstract
 :  Data quality is one of the most important problems in data management\,
  since dirty data often leads to inaccurate data analytics results and wro
 ng business decisions. Poor data across businesses and the government cost
  the U.S. economy $3.1 trillion a year\, according to a report by InsightS
 quared in 2012. Data scientists reportedly spend 60% of their time in clea
 ning and organizing the data according to a survey published in Forbes in 
 2016. Therefore\, we need to design effective and efficient techniques to 
 reduce the human efforts in data cleaning.\n Data cleaning activities usua
 lly consist of two phases: error detection and error repair. Error detecti
 on techniques can generally be classified as either quantitative or qualit
 ative. Quantitative error detection techniques often involve statistical a
 nd machine learning methods to identify abnormal behaviors and errors. Qua
 ntitative error detection techniques have been mostly studied in the conte
 xt of outlier detection. Qualitative error detection techniques rely on de
 scriptive approaches to specify patterns or constraints of a legal data in
 stance. One common way of specifying those patterns or constraints is by u
 sing data quality rules. Qualitative error detection techniques based on d
 ata quality rules capture errors by identifying violations of the specifie
 d rules. This dissertation focuses on tackling the challenges associated w
 ith detecting and repairing qualitative errors.\n To clean a dirty dataset
  using rule-based qualitative data cleaning techniques\, we first need to 
 design data quality rules that reflect the semantics of the data. One way 
 to obtain data quality rules is by consulting domain experts\, which requi
 res a lot of domain expertise and is usually a time-consuming processing. 
 Therefore\, we need automatic techniques to discover data quality rules. W
 e show how to mine data quality rules expressed in the formalism of denial
  constraints (DCs). We choose DCs as the formal language for capturing dat
 a quality rules because it is able to capture many real-life data quality 
 rules\, and at the same time it allows for efficient discovery algorithm\,
  as we will show in this dissertation.\n In detecting qualitative errors\,
  we tackle the scalability challenges associated with it\, as error detect
 ion often requires a tuple pairwise comparison\, a quadratic complexity th
 at is expensive for a large dataset. We present a distribution strategy th
 at distributes the error detection workload evenly to a cluster of machine
 s in a parallel shared-nothing computing environment. Our proposed distrib
 ution strategy aims at minimizing the maximum computation cost and the max
 imum communication cost across all machines\, which are the two main types
  of cost one needs to consider in a shared-nothing environment.\n In repai
 ring qualitative errors\, we propose a holistic data cleaning technique\, 
 which accumulates evidences from a broad spectrum of data quality rules\, 
 and suggests possible data updates in a holistic manner. Compared with pre
 vious piece-meal data repairing approaches\, the holistic approach produce
 s data updates with higher accuracy because it realizes the interactions b
 etween different errors using one representation\, and aims at generating 
 data updates that can fix as many errors as possible.  \n \n \n

 t do not cover the wide range of words used on the Internet. \n In this th
 esis\, we propose a cross-disciplinary approach that incorporates Affect C
 ontrol Theory (ACT) into a structured model to determine three-dimensional
  sentiment polarity of event-based articles from the readers and interac
 tants perspectives. ACT is a socio-mathematical theory that models human
 s' sentiment towards social events in a three-dimensional space and estima
 tes the situational post-event sentiment by considering the interaction be
 tween these sentiments. \n We develop an algorithm that performs a fine-gr
 ained events extraction from English sentences using a combination of sema
 ntic and syntactic parsing techniques. We also augment an ACT three-dimens
 ional lexicon in a semi-supervised fashion using a graph-based label propa
 gation method built upon semantic and distributed word representations. Us
 ing the extracted events\, the augmented lexicon\, and the ACT mathematica
 l equations\, we propose an entity-based sentiment analysis approach that 
 models the readers triggered emotions from event-based sentences toward 
 the events and their associated entities. We also propose an ACT-based mod
 el to predict the temporal progression of the interactants emotions and 
 their optimal behaviour (acts) over a sequence of interactions. We evaluat
 e the first approach on a manually annotated news headline corpus and the 
 second on three different types of corpora: fairy tales\, news articles\, 
 and a hand-crafted corpus. \n The results demonstrate that\, despite the c
 hallenging structure of the sentences\, there was a reasonable agreement b
 etween the estimated emotions and behaviours and their corresponding groun
 d truths.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Mustafa Elsheikh\, David R. Cheriton School of Compu
 ter Science\nTitle:   "Smith Normal Form over Local Rings and Related Prob
 lems" \n\nAbstract:  Smith normal form is a diagonalization of matrices wi
 th many applications in diophantine analysis\, graph theory\, system contr
 ol theory\, simplified homology\, and\, more recently\, in topographic dat
 a analysis of big data. Efficient computation of Smith form is a well-stud
 ied area for matrices with integer and polynomial entries. Existing succes
 sful algorithms typically rely on elimination for dense matrices and itera
 tive Krylov space methods for sparse matrices.\n Our interest lies in comp
 uting Smith normal form for sparse matrices over local rings\, where tradi
 tional iterative methods face challenges due to the lack of unique minimal
  polynomials. We explore different approaches to tackling this problem for
  two local rings: integers modulo prime powers\, and polynomials modulo po
 wer of an irreducible element. Over local polynomial rings\, we find succe
 ss in linearization into larger dimension matrices over the base field. Ef
 fectively\, we transform the problem of computing Smith normal form into a
  small number of rank problems over the base field. The latter problem has
  existing efficient algorithms.\n The problem is harder over local integer
  rings. We take the approach of hybrid sparse-dense algorithms. We also ta
 ckle a restricted version of the problem where we detect only the first no
 n-trivial invariant factor. We also give an algorithm to find the first fe
 w invariant factors using iterative rank-1 updates. This method becomes de
 nse when applied to finding all the invariant factors.\n We digress slight
 ly into the related problem of preconditioning. We show that linearization
  preconditions are suitable for computing Smith normal form\, and computin
 g nullspace samples. For the latter problem\, we design an algorithm for c
 omputing uniform samples from the nullspace.\n On a separate track\, we fo
 cus on the properties of the Smith normal form decomposition. We relate th
 e invariant factors to eigenvalues. Our ultimate goal is to extend the app
 lications of numerical algorithms for computing eigenvalues to computing t
 he invariant factors of symbolic matrices.  \n \n \n

  Mathematics" \n\nAbstract:  In the spring of 2016\, the motion picture\, 
 The Man Who Knew Innity\, was released. It is now available on DVD. The m
 ovie tells the life story of the Indian genius\, Ramanujan. In this talk\,
  I hope to start with the trailer from the movie. Then I shall provide som
 e discussion of Ramanujan's life. I plan to provide a glimpse of his mathe
 matics contained in the celebrated Lost Notebook. I hope to conclude with 
 some discussion of how computer algebra illuminates our study of the many 
 challenges left by Ramanujan.  \n \n
