DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Walaa Moursi\, Stanford University\nTitle:   "The Do
 uglas-Rachford splitting algorithm for inconsistent minimization problems"
  \n\nAbstract:  The Douglas--Rachford (DR) method is one of the most \npop
 ular splitting methods in optimization.\nThe method was first introduced i
 n 1956 to numerically solve certain types of heat equations. \nIn their se
 minal work Lions (a Fields' medalist) and Mercier extended the algorithm t
 o find a zero \nof the sum of two\, not necessarily linear and possibly se
 t-valued\, maximally monotone operators in possibly infinite-dimensional H
 ilbert spaces.\nNowadays\, the method is a very popular splitting techniqu
 e for finding a minimizer of the sum of two convex functions\, more genera
 lly a zero of the sum of two maximally monotone operators.\nNonetheless\, 
 the behaviour of the algorithm remains mysterious in the general inconsist
 ent case\, i.e.\, when the sum problem has no zeros\, which corresponds to
  the absence of minimizers. However\, more than a decade ago\, it was show
 n that in the (possibly inconsistent) convex feasibility setting\, the so-
 called shadow sequence remains bounded and its weak cluster points solve a
  best approximation problem. In this talk\, we advance the understanding o
 f the inconsistent case significantly by presenting a complete proof of th
 e full weak convergence in the convex feasibility setting. We also provide
  strong and linear rates of convergence in special cases.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Ehsaan Hossain\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, Un
 iversity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Problems on sofic and hyperlinear groups" 
 \n\nAbstract:  A sofic group is one that can be locally approximated by fi
 nite groups\; it is equivalent to embed into a "metric ultraproduct'' of f
 inite groups. A hyperlinear group is the same thing except with unitary ma
 trix groups instead of finite ones. So every sofic group is hyperlinear\, 
 but it is still standing whether these classes are the same. In fact nobod
 y knows even one example of a group that is not sofic or hyperlinear!\n So
 fic/hyperlinear groups are amongst the largest classes of groups for which
  various famous problems have been verified: Connes's embedding problem\, 
 Gottschalk surjunctivity\, and Kaplansky's group rings problems\, amongst 
 others --- so the problems in soficity can give solutions for even some of
  the biggest conjectures in other subjects. I'll learn about these and let
  you know what I find\, and as the semester progresses\, let's try to get 
 our hands dirty with these groups and see what the field is like.  \n \n \

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Ricardo Salmon\, David R. Cheriton School of Compute
 r Science\nTitle:   "From SAT to Stochastic SAT" \n\nAbstract:  Stochastic
  satisfiability (SSAT) problems are an extension of SAT problems that is P
 SPACE-complete and in the same complexity class as quantified Boolean form
 ula (QBF) and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs).\n W
 e show how to extend techniques from SAT into a stochastic solver called P
 rime\, that solves probabilistic inference and POMDP problems. Similar to 
 SAT and other NP-hard problems\, where a lot of research has been invested
 \, we hope to encourage further research into SSAT. The results show that 
 our solver is able to tackle large problems and is very competitive.  \n \

 w-Cost Maps in Computer Science and Data Analysis" \n\nAbstract:  The gene
 ral mathematical problem of computing low-cost maps between two metric spa
 ces is prevalent in many applications\, including registration in medical 
 image processing\, function detection in protein modeling\, reconstructing
  evolutionary trees in phylogenomics\, finding recurrent patterns in data 
 analysis\, and finding simple representations of data in visualization. Ma
 ny instances of the general problem are provably hard\, so we have a dicho
 tomy. On one hand\, we have general algorithms with theoretical worst-case
  guarantees that are prohibitively slow in practice\, and on the other we 
 have faster heuristics engineered for specific applications\, but lacking 
 guarantees. In dichotomy is opportunity  we use parameterized complexity
  to create a finer understanding of the complexity of computing low-cost m
 aps between metric spaces based on their geometric and topological propert
 ies. We specifically target new algorithms with better performance guarant
 ees\, in particular\, for cases of practical interest.\n In this talk\, I 
 focus on two instances of low-cost maps: embeddings with low multiplicativ
 e distortion\, and homeomorphisms with low Frechet length. Specifically\, 
 I present new results on embedding into tree-like metrics\, and computing 
 the Frechet distance between surfaces.\n      \n Bio : Amir 
 Nayyeri works on algorithm design. Specifically\, he is interested in fund

 dern Classification with Big Data" \n\nRemarks:  Refreshments will be prov

 red in the era of "big data" and revolutionized the scientific research. B
 ig data creates golden opportunities but has also arisen unprecedented cha
 llenges due to the massive size and complex structure of the data. Among m
 any tasks in statistics and machine learning\, classification has diverse 
 applications\, ranging from improving daily life to reaching the new front
 iers of science and engineering. This talk will discuss the envisions of b
 roader approaches to modern classification methodologies\, as well as comp
 utational considerations to cope with the big data challenges. I will pres
 ent a modern classification method named data-driven generalized distance-
 weighted discrimination. A fast algorithm with an emphasis on computationa
 l efficiency for big data will be introduced. Our method is formulated in 
 a reproducing kernel Hilbert space\, and learning theory of the Bayes risk
  consistency will be developed. In addition\, I will use extensive benchma
 rk data applications to demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of our me
 thod is highly competitive with state-of-the-art classification methods in
 cluding support vector machine\, random forest\, gradient boosting\, and d
 eep neural network.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Shai Ben-David\, David R. Cheriton School of Compute
 r Science\nTitle:   "A Basic Learning Problem that is Independent of the S
 et Theory ZFC Axioms" \n\nAbstract:  We consider the Expectation Maximizat
 ion (EMX) problem that captures many well-studied learning problems. We st
 udy the interaction between the statistical sample complexity of a class o
 f functions and its combinatorial structure. Surprisingly\, we show that t
 he EMX learnability\, as well as the learning rates of some basic class of
  functions F\, depend on the cardinality of the continuum in the model of 
 set theory one "lives in" and is therefore  independent of the set theory 
 ZFC axioms (that are widely accepted as a formalization of the notion of a
  mathematical proof).\n This result implies that there exist no finitery
  combinatorial parameter that characterizes EMX learnability in a way si
 milar to the VC-dimension characterization of binary valued classification
  problems.\n The talk is based on joint work with Pavel Hrube\, Shay Mor

 University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "The Hyperreals (Infinitesimals and the t
 ransfer principle)" \n\nAbstract:  Intuitive discussions about calculus am
 ong those 'uninitiated' into proper analysis often involve discussions abo
 ut "infinitely small" quantities. Foundations of calculus\, of course\, fr
 ame these as limiting processes\, but can an actual concept of an infinite
 simal number be recovered and worked with directly? Turns out the answer i
 s "yes": we may enlarge the real line in such a way that there are infinit
 esimal quantities\, those strictly greater than zero but less than every 1
 /n. \n In fact\, the real numbers and the hyperreal numbers are closely re
 lated: facts about one can be translated to facts about the other. Thus\, 
 understanding the real line helps us to understand the hyperreal line\, an
 d interestingly\, the converse as well. In particular\, certain proofs in 
 analysis admit simpler proofs\, once the techniques of "non-standard analy
 sis" have been introduced.  \n \n \n

  Graphical structure\, Geometry\, and Applications" \n\nAbstract:  Various
  problems in areas such as robotics\, power systems\, computer vision\, cr

  polynomial equations\, and in many cases the resulting systems have a sim
 ple sparsity structure. In the  first part of this talk we represent this 
 sparsity structure with a graph\, and study the algorithmic and complexity
  consequences of this graphical abstraction. In particular\, we derive nov
 el algorithms to solve polynomial systems. These methods outperform existi
 ng techniques by orders of magnitude in certain applications from algebrai
 c statistics and vector addition systems.\n The second part of this talk f
 ocuses on the problem of minimizing a polynomial function subject to polyn
 omial equality constraints. This problem captures many important applicati
 ons\, including Max-Cut\, tensor low rank approximation\, the triangulatio
 n problem\, and rotation synchronization. Although these problems are nonc
 onvex\, tractable semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations have been pro
 posed. We show novel guarantees on the quality of this relaxations. In par
 ticular\, we prove that estimation problems such as camera triangulation\,
  rank one tensor approximation and rotation synchronization can be solved 
 exactly by SDP relaxations in the low noise regime.  \n \n \n

 ersity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Complexity and Capacity Bounds for Operator 
 Systems and Quantum Channels" \n\nAbstract:  This is based on joint work w
 ith R. Levine and I. Todorov.   \n  Shannon introduced the concept of the 
 one-shot zero-error capacity of a classical channel and proved that each s
 uch channel had a graph affiliated with it so that the one-shot zero-error
  capacity was the independence number of the graph.  The zero-error capaci
 ty is then obtained by taking the k-th root of the strong product of the g
 raph with itself k times and taking the supremum over k.  Shannon admitted
 ly couldnt compute this value for many graphs\, but then Lovasz introduc
 ed his theta function of a graph as a computable upper bound. The Lovasz t
 heta bound is still the best known bound for this capacity.\n Dean\, Sever
 ini\, and Winter studied Shannons ideas for quantum channels and proved 
 that each quantum channel has affiliated with it an operator system such t
 hat the one-shot zero-error capacity of the channel is the "independence n
 umber of the operator system. They then argued that the analogue of Shan
 nons capacity is to take the k-th root of the independence number of the
  tensor product of the operator system with itself k times and take the su
 premum over k.  They then introduced the analogue of the Lovasz theta func
 tion for an operator system.\n In this talk we will review these ideas and
  then introduce our new idea of the "complexity" of an operator system and
  show that this gives another bound on the zero-error capacity of the quan
 tum channel.  We will present several different linear algebraic character
 izations of complexity. We will then show that there are some operator sys
 tems and quantum channels for which our complexity based bound is better t
 han the Lovasz bound.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Josef Tkadlec\, PhD candidate\, Institute of Science
  and Technology\, Austria\nTitle:   "Evolutionary Graph Theory" \n\nAbstra
 ct:  Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices with one random vertex coloured bl
 ack and all the other vertices coloured white. In the language of populati
 on genetics\, this corresponds to a single (advantageous) mutant appearing
  in a structured population of indistinguishable residents. Moran process 
 is a certain discrete-time stochastic process that changes the colouring o
 f the vertices in such a way that eventually the vertices become either al
 l white (the mutant went extinct) or all black (the mutant fixated). \
 n Evolutionary graph theory studies how the fixation probability $\\fp(G)$
  depends on the underlying graph structure. For example it is known that $
 \\fp(K_n)=\\fp(C_n)<\\fp(S_n)$ where $K_n$\, $C_n$\, $S_n$ are the complet
 e graph\, the cycle\, and the star\, respectively. In this talk we will gi
 ve an overview of the research done in the field and present some recent r
 esults concerning graphs for which the fixation probability tends to 1 as 
 the number of vertices tends to infinity.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Christine Dow\, Department of Geography & Environmen
 tal Management\, University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Numerical modeling appr
 oaches for examining water flow under ice sheets." \n\nAbstract:  The pres
 ence of water at the bed of the Antarctic ice sheets is known to be a firs
 t order control on the speed of the overlying ice. In many regions\, distr
 ibution and flux of this water is complicated by multi-year storage in sub
 glacial lake basins. With more lakes and pockets of stored water being ide
 ntified every year from satellite surface altimetry measurements and radio
 -echo sounding\, it is apparent that constraining the impact of this water
  is an important step for determining the drivers of Antarctic ice dynamic
 s.\n Using a numerical modeling approach\, I examine the controls on subgl
 acial Antarctic lake growth and drainage within ice streams. I also assess
  whether the drainage of these lakes has an impact on the dynamics of the 
 ice stream. The methods to achieve this utilize GlaDS\, a 2-D finite eleme
 nt subglacial hydrology model\, which incorporates development of a coexis
 ting distributed and efficient drainage system. The model is applied both 
 to a synthetic system and to Recovery Ice Stream in the East Antarctic wit
 h bed topography determined from mass conservation inversion techniques. T
 he model outputs of lake growth and drainage are compared with satellite s
 urface altimetry measurements.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Dimitrios Skrepetos\, David R. Cheriton School of Co
 mputer Science\nTitle:   "Faster Approximate  Diameter and Distance Oracle
 s in Planar Graphs" \n\nAbstract:  We present an algorithm that computes a
  (1+\\varepsilon)-approximation of the diameter of a weighted\, undirected
  planar graph of n vertices with non-negative edge lengths in O(n \\log n 
 (\\log n + (1/\\varepsilon)^5)) expected time\, improving upon the O(n ((1
 /\\varepsilon)^4 \\log^4 n + 2^{O(1/\\varepsilon)}))-time algorithm of Wei
 mann and Yuster [ICALP 2013]. \n Our algorithm makes two improvements over
  that result: first and foremost\, it replaces the exponential dependency 
 on 1/\\varepsilon with a polynomial one\, by adapting and specializing Cab
 ello's recent abstract-Voronoi-diagram-based technique [SODA 2017] for app
 roximation purposes\; second\, it shaves off two logarithmic factors by ch
 oosing a better sequence of error parameters  during recursion. \n Moreove
 r\, using similar techniques\, we improve the (1+\\varepsilon)-approximate
  distance oracle of Gu and Xu [ISAAC 2015] by first replacing the exponent
 ial dependency on 1/\\varepsilon on the preprocessing time and space with 
 a polynomial one and second removing a logarithmic factor from the preproc
 essing time.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Pedram Ghodsnia\, David R. Cheriton School of Comput
 er Science\nTitle:   "Effective Use of SSDs in Database Systems" \n\nAbstr
 act:  With the advent of solid state drives (SSDs)\, the storage industry 
 has experienced a revolutionary improvement in I/O performance. Compared t
 o traditional hard disk drives (HDDs)\, SSDs benefit from shorter I/O late
 ncy\, better power efficiency\, and cheaper random I/Os. Because of these 
 superior properties\, SSDs are gradually replacing HDDs. For decades\, dat
 abase management systems have been designed\, architected\, and optimized 
 based on the performance characteristics of HDDs.  In order to utilize the
  superior performance of SSDs\, new methods should be developed\, some dat
 abase components should be redesigned\, and architectural decisions should
  be revisited.\n In this thesis\, novel methods are proposed to exploit th
 e new capabilities of modern SSDs to improve the performance of database s
 ystems. The first is a new method for using SSDs as a fully persistent sec
 ond level memory buffer pool. This method uses SSDs as a supplementary sto
 rage device to improve transactional throughput and to reduce the checkpoi
 nt and recovery times. A prototype of the proposed method is compared with
  its closest existing competitor. The second considers the impact of the p
 arallel I/O capability of modern SSDs on the database query optimizer. It 
 is shown that a query optimizer that is unaware of the parallel I/O capabi
 lity of SSDs can make significantly sub-optimal decisions. In addition\, a
  practical method for making the query optimizer parallel-I/O-aware is int
 roduced and evaluated empirically. The third technique is an SSD-friendly 
 external merge sort. This sorting technique has better performance than ot
 her common external sorting techniques. It also improves the SSD's lifespa
 n by reducing the number of write operations required during sorting.  \n
