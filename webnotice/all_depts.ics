 l Deveau\,\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, University of Waterloo\nComp
 utability Learning Seminar\n\n\nWe introduce the notion of a computable fu
 nctor and the definition of effective inter- pretability. The former is a 
 computable analogue of a category-theoretic functor between ω-presentatio
 ns of structures\, and the latter is an effective version of model-theoret
 ic inter- pretability. We show that effective interpretations induce compu
 table functors\, and briefly mention the converse.

 r main steps of the construction: resolving the orbifold singularities by 
 performing a fibre-wise blow up. The important point is that there is no n
 atural torsion-free G2 structure on this third glueing region. The natural
  G2 structure is not even closed. There is a natural way to correct it to 
 be closed\, which we will discuss. The third step is correcting this furth

DESCRIPTION:Graph Routing Problems: Approximation\, Hardness\, and Graph-T
 heoretic Insights\nDr. Julia Chuzhoy\, Toyota Technological Institute at C
 hicago\nSeminar\n\n\nIn a typical routing problem\, we are given a graph G
 \, and a collection(s_1\,t_1)\,..\,(s_k\,t_k) of pairs of its vertices\, c
 alled demand pairs\, that we would like to route. In order to route a dema
 nd pair (s_i\,t_i)\, we need to choose a path connecting s_i to t_i in G. 
 Our goal is usually to route as many of the demand pairs as possible\, whi
 le keeping the congestion of the routing - the maximum load on any vertex 
 or an edge of G - as small as possible. This general framework gives rise 
 to a number of basic and widely studied graph routing problems\, that have
  lead to the development of a rich toolkit of algorithmic techniques\, as 
 well as structural graph theoretic results. In this talk we will describe 
 some of the recent developments in approximation algorithms for graph rout
 ing problems\, and highlight some connections between this area and graph 
 theory.

  some classification results\, started by Deborah Lockett\, and which I su
 bsequently expanded on.  For my friends in PMATH\, this should serve as a 
 gentle and entertaining introduction to the terminology of graph theory.  
 For my friends in CO\, this is a really easy area to get into\, containing

DESCRIPTION:Tight lower bounds for the complexity of multicoloring\nMarthe
  Boname\, University of Bordeaux\nColloquium\n\n\nIn the multicoloring pro
 blem\, also known as $(a:b)$ or $b$-fold coloring\, we are given a graph $
 G$ and a set of a colors\, and the task is to assign a subset of $b$ color
 s to each vertex of $G$ so that adjacent vertices receive disjoint color s
 ubsets. This natural generalization of the classic coloring problem (the $
 b=1$ case) is equivalent to finding a homomorphism to the Kneser graph wit
 h parameters a and b. It is tightly connected with the fractional chromati
 c number\, and has multiple applications within computer science.\nWe stud
 y the complexity of determining whether a graph has an $(a:b)$-coloring. N
 ederlof showed in 2008 a $(b+1)^n*n^O(1)$-time algorithm for $(a:b)$-color
 ing. Our main result is that this is essentially optimal: there is no algo
 rithm with running time $2^o(log b)⋅n$ unless the Exponential Time Hypot
 hesis fails. The crucial ingredient in our hardness reduction is the usage
  of detecting matrices of Lindstr| om (1965)\, which is a combinatorial 
 tool that\, to the best of our knowledge\, has not yet been used for provi
 ng complexity lower bounds. This talk is also meant as an introduction to 
 the ETH.

 P\,Q$ invertible over $R$ for which $PAQ$ is a diagonal matrix diag$(e_1\,
 \\dots\,e_r\,0\,\\dots\,0)$\, where $e_i$ divides $e_{i+1}$ in $R$. We the
 n call $PAQ$ a \\emph{Smith normal form}(SNF) of $A$. If $R$ is a PID then
  an SNF always exists and is unique up to multiplication by units. Moreove
