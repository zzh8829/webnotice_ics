DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Michael Deveau\,\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, 
 University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Computable Functors and Effective Inte
 rpretability" \n\nAbstract:  We introduce the notion of a computable fun
 ctor and the definition of effective inter- pretability. The former is a c
 omputable analogue of a category-theoretic functor between ω-presentation
 s of structures\, and the latter is an effective version of model-theoreti
 c inter- pretability. We show that effective interpretations induce comput
 able functors\, and briefly mention the converse.  \n \n \n

 bstract:  Given a base 1\\less q\\le 2\, following Renyi (1957) we conside
 r expansions of the form\n x=\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{c_i}{q^i}\n with 
 digits $c_i$ belonging to $\\{0\,1\\}$.\nIn case $q=2$ of the familiar bin
 ary expansions every $x\\in [0\,1]$ has an expansion\, and this is unique 
 except the dyadic rational numbers that have two expansions. \n The case $
 1 We determine the values of $q$ for which $U_q$ is closed or even a Canto
 r set. \nThese values have unexpected number-theoretical properties.\nMore
 over\, we determine the Hausdorff dimension of the sets $U_q$.\nIt turns o

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Diane Watson\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer 
 Science\nTitle:   "Reading Garden: A Case Study of an In-Classroom Motivat

 wn to improve student outcomes by accommodating multiple learning types an
 d reinforcing material learned in class\; however\, most students do not o
 ften complete assigned readings. We created Reading Garden\, a motivationa
 l game aimed to get students to read more of the textbook. Reading Garden 
 is a casual\, multiplayer game following common design patterns of many so
 cial games. For example\, it follows the free-to-play model\, where the ga
 me can always be played for free\, but has special advanced actions and de
 corations that can be purchased with gold  a special in-game currency. P
 layers earn gold by completing assigned readings.\n We then deployed Readi
 ng Garden in three iterations of a human computer interaction courses\, in
  two different departments\, at the University of Waterloo. Each study fea
 tured an entire class playing the game simultaneously throughout the four-
 month term. This talk will discuss the results of those ecologically valid
  deployments\, as well as the ethical challenges associated with conductin
 g studies in classrooms.  \n \n \n

 t to be closed\, which we will discuss. The third step is correcting this 
 further to remove the leading error term in the torsion\, which is the thi

 will be provided.  \n\nAbstract:  Interpreting the results of a statistica
 l analysis would be easier if all variables were uncorrelated and all data
  sets consisted of orthogonal x-variables. Principal components is one way
  of obtaining orthogonal/uncorrelated variables\, but the relationship bet
 ween the principal components and the original x-variables is complex. Thi
 s talk proposes two transformations that give orthogonal/uncorrelated comp
 onents with a close one-to-one correspondence between the x-variables and 
 the components.\n The transformations have a number of useful applications
  including:\n a unified approach to the identification and diagnosis of co
 llinearities\nevaluating the contributions of individual variables to a Ma
 halanobis distance or the test statistic of a Hotelling test\nsetting prio
 r weights for Bayesian model averaging\nevaluating the contributions of in
 dividual variables to a multiple regression\ncalculation of an upper bound
  for a multivariate Chebyshev inequality.\nThe talk will focus on the firs

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Dr. Julia Chuzhoy\, Toyota Technological Institute a
 t Chicago\nTitle:   "Graph Routing Problems: Approximation\, Hardness\, an
 d Graph-Theoretic Insights" \n\nAbstract:  In a typical routing problem\, 
 we are given a graph G\, and a collection(s_1\,t_1)\,..\,(s_k\,t_k) of pai
 rs of its vertices\, called demand pairs\, that we would like to route. In
  order to route a demand pair (s_i\,t_i)\, we need to choose a path connec
 ting s_i to t_i in G. Our goal is usually to route as many of the demand p
 airs as possible\, while keeping the congestion of the routing - the maxim
 um load on any vertex or an edge of G - as small as possible. This general
  framework gives rise to a number of basic and widely studied graph routin
 g problems\, that have lead to the development of a rich toolkit of algori
 thmic techniques\, as well as structural graph theoretic results. In this 
 talk we will describe some of the recent developments in approximation alg
 orithms for graph routing problems\, and highlight some connections betwee
 n this area and graph theory.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Marthe Boname\, University of Bordeaux\nTitle:   "Ti
 ght lower bounds for the complexity of multicoloring" \n\nAbstract:  In th
 e multicoloring problem\, also known as $(a:b)$ or $b$-fold coloring\, we 
 are given a graph $G$ and a set of a colors\, and the task is to assign a 
 subset of $b$ colors to each vertex of $G$ so that adjacent vertices recei
 ve disjoint color subsets. This natural generalization of the classic colo
 ring problem (the $b=1$ case) is equivalent to finding a homomorphism to t
 he Kneser graph with parameters a and b. It is tightly connected with the 
 fractional chromatic number\, and has multiple applications within compute
 r science.\nWe study the complexity of determining whether a graph has an 
 $(a:b)$-coloring. Nederlof showed in 2008 a $(b+1)^n*n^O(1)$-time algorith
 m for $(a:b)$-coloring. Our main result is that this is essentially optima
 l: there is no algorithm with running time $2^o(log b)⋅n$ unless the Exp
 onential Time Hypothesis fails. The crucial ingredient in our hardness red
 uction is the usage of detecting matrices of Lindstr| om (1965)\, which 
 is a combinatorial tool that\, to the best of our knowledge\, has not yet 
 been used for proving complexity lower bounds. This talk is also meant as 
 an introduction to the ETH.\n This is joint work with  {\\L}ukasz Kowalik\

 ata in Water Distribution Industry" \n\nAbstract:  The project involves th
 e analysis of procurement auctions for water infrastructure maintenance pr
 ojects for Cities of Niagara Falls and London. The primary concern of this
  proposal is to generate a reliable mechanism for importing different form
 ats of the tender summaries\, provided as input data\, of the projects and
  unify them in a database for further exploration and processing. For this
  part of the research\, I developed a water infrastructure ontology to sta
 ndardize the different aspects of the knowledge available in this field\, 
 which would eventually help us to import the data and look for any context
 ual inconsistencies and errors and act appropriately to repair them.\n The
  next part of the project\, the primary focus the study\, is to analyze th
 e historical auction data to extract various valuable pieces of informatio
 n from them such as inflation rate and unit project prices. Also\, it is p
 ossible to look into generating a profile of each recurrent bidder (contra
 ctor) and establish the statistical likelihood model of their behaviour. T
 herefore\, any future auction can be inspected and compared to these profi
 les and any discrepancies or unexpected or highly unlikely behaviour that 
 would raise a red flag can be found for further investigation. A comprehen
 sive list of features that can act as the indicators of bidder behaviour i
 s presented in this proposal\, as well. The preliminary goal is to minimiz
 e the probability of any possible collusion (or find them if any exists) a
 nd detect unusual behaviours that might exist in the procurement auctions.

 times n$ matrices $P\,Q$ invertible over $R$ for which $PAQ$ is a diagonal
  matrix diag$(e_1\,\\dots\,e_r\,0\,\\dots\,0)$\, where $e_i$ divides $e_{i
 +1}$ in $R$. We then call $PAQ$ a \\emph{Smith normal form}(SNF) of $A$. I
 f $R$ is a PID then an SNF always exists and is unique up to multiplicatio
 n by units. Moreover if $A$ is invertible then $\\det A=u\\alpha_1\\cdots 
 \\alpha n$\, where $u$ is a unit\, so SNF gives a canonical factorization 
 of $\\det A$.\n We will survey some connections between SNF and combinator

 ix of integers (joint work with Yinghui Wang)\, (4) SNF of special classes

 a that can be read and augmented by everyone. Shared public ledgers stand 
 to revolutionize the way a democratic society operates. They secure all ki
 nds of traditional transactions  such as payments\, asset transfers\, ti
 tling  in the exact order in which they occur\, and enable totally new t
 ransactions  such as cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. They can remo
 ve intermediaries and usher in a new paradigm for trust. As currently impl
 emented\, however\, public ledgers cannot achieve their enormous potential
 .\n Algorand is a quite alternative\, truly democratic\, and very efficien
 t way to implement a public ledger. Unlike prior implementations based on 
 proof of work\, it requires a negligible amount of computation\, and gener
 ates a transaction history that will not fork with overwhelmingly high
  probability. \n      \n Dr. Silvio Micali has received his

  Algebras to Machine learning via Rough Paths" \n\nAbstract:  Rough path t
 heory aims to build an effective calculus that can model the interactions 
 between complex oscillatory (rough) evolving systems. At its mathematical 
 foundations\, it is a combination of analysis blended with algebra that go
 es back to LC Young\, and to KT Chen. Key to the theory is the essential n
 eed to incorporate additional non-commutative structure into areas of math
 ematics we thought were stable. At its high points\, there are the regular
 ity structures of Martin Hairer that allow robust meaning to be given to n
 umerous core nonlinear stochastic pdes describing evolving interfaces in p
 hysics.\n Classic results\, by Clark\, Cameron and Dickinson\, demonstrate
  that a nonlinear approach to the data is essential.  Rough path theory li
 ves up to this challenge and can be viewed as providing fundamentally more
  efficient ways of approximately describing complex data\; approaches that
 \, after penetrating the basic ideas\, are computationally tractable and l
 ead to new scalable ways to regress\, classify\, and learn functional rela
 tionships from data. One non-mathematical application that is already stri
 king is the use of signatures on a daily basis in the online recognition o
 f Chinese Handwriting on mobile phones.  \n \n \n

 n some fixed polynomial time\, assuming widely-conjectured worst-case hard
 ness of certain problems from the study of fine-grained complexity.\n We d
 iscuss the relevance of such average-case hardness to cryptography and pre
 sent\, as an illustration\, an outline of a proof-of-work protocol constru
 cted based on the hardness and certain structural properties of our functi
 ons. \n This work is joint with Marshall Ball\, Alon Rosen and Manuel Sabi
 n.\n      \n Bio : Prashant Nalini Vasudevan is a student at
  MIT\, advised by Vinod Vaikuntanathan. He is interested broadly in comple
 xity theory and cryptography\, and narrowly in the understanding the funda
 mentals of complexity-based cryptography\, which involves questions like w
 hat sorts of functions are useful when they are hard and what generic assu

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Ivana Kajić\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer 
 Science\nTitle:   "A Biologically Constrained Model of Semantic Memory Sea
 rch" \n\nAbstract:  The semantic fluency task has been used to understand 
 the effects of semantic relationships on human memory search. A variety of
  computational models have been proposed that explain human behavioral dat
 a\, yet it remains unclear how millions of spiking neurons work in unison 
 to realize the cognitive processes involved in memory search. \n In this t
 alk\, I will present a biologically constrained neural network model that 
 performs the task in a fashion similar to humans. The model reproduces exp
 erimentally observed response timing effects\, as well as similarity trend
 s within and across semantic categories derived from responses. Three diff
 erent sources of the association data have been tested by embedding associ
 ations in neural connections\, with free association norms providing the b
 est match.  \n \n
