DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Trevor Brown\, Postdoctoral fellow\, Institute of Sc
 ience and Technology\, Austria\nTitle:   "Towards Correct and Efficient Mu
 lti-core Programming" \n\nAbstract:  The last decade of technological adva
 ncement has ushered in an era of ubiquitous data\, generated by vast swath
 es of always-on and always-connected consumer devices\, industrial process
 es and academic projects. As the amount of available data and the variety 
 of its potential uses increases\, data processing is quickly becoming miss
 ion-critical for many organizations. Large scale multi-core systems repres
 ent the best available solution to these data processing needs. However\, 
 it is notoriously difficult to program such systems\, even for experts. Th
 e research challenge is to determine how large scale multi-core systems ca
 n be programmed easily\, correctly and efficiently. \n In this talk\, I wi
 ll describe two projects that address different aspects of this challenge.
  The first project introduces new tools for designing concurrent data stru
 ctures that are fast and provably correct. These data structures function 
 as essential algorithmic building blocks in concurrent software. The secon
 d project encompasses techniques for improving the performance of existing
  concurrent data structures and expanding their capabilities. These techni
 ques improve performance in application benchmarks by up to three orders o
 f magnitude over previous approaches. \n      \n Bio : Trevo
 r Brown is a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute of Science and Technolog
 y\, Austria. Prior to joining IST Austria\, he was a postdoctoral fellow a
 t the Technion\, Israel Institute of Technology. His research spans a vari
 ety of topics centered around the question of how large multi-core systems
  can be programmed easily\, correctly and efficiently. These topics includ
 e non-volatile memory\, transactional memory\, memory management\, concurr
 ent data structures\, lock-free algorithms and databases. He obtained his 
 PhD in Computer Science from the University of Toronto in 2017. Before his
  PhD studies\, he worked in industry as a software engineer.  \n \n \n

 ract:  In the computing landscape of the modern world\, our devices and sy
 stems\, including PCs\, servers\, industrial control systems\, and smart/e
 mbedded devices\, are increasingly relying on programs for which the sourc
 e code is unavailable to end users\, security analysts\, and even manufact
 urers  termed binary programs. Oftentimes\, binary programs are not 
 fully secure\, and through these devices and systems\, vulnerabilities in 
 binaries may have a broad impact on society. Because of the intrinsic comp
 lexity of programs\, the discovery and mitigation of vulnerabilities in bi
 naries is generally viewed as a difficult task. It is only more difficult 
 due to the loss of information\, especially semantics\, through compilatio
 n and optimization.\n In this talk\, I will present my research on improvi
 ng the discovery and mitigation of vulnerabilities in binaries without req
 uiring source code. I approach this goal from different angles. I will fir
 st discuss improvements on traditional vulnerability discovery techniques\
 , such as fuzz testing\, by complementing them with assistance from either
  symbolic execution engines or intelligence from non-expert humans. I will
  then showcase a novel technique for static binary rewriting with extremel
 y low overhead\, which greatly reduces the performance impact of vulnerabi
 lity mitigation and program hardening on binaries. These techniques are bu
 ilt upon the angr binary analysis platform\, which I co-founded and mainta
 in to help foster the future of binary analysis.\n      \n B

 , Georgia Institute of Technology\nTitle:   "Securing Hardware-based Trust
 ed Execution Environment" \n\nAbstract:  Recently\, hardware starts to ado
 pt security mechanisms that satisfy both robustness and efficiency. One no
 table example is a hardware-based trusted execution environment (TEE)\, su
 ch as Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX)\, that allows a user applicati
 on to have a secure and isolated execution environment for confidential co
 mputations without relying on underlying systems software (e.g.\, operatin
 g system and hypervisor) and its administrators. However\, recent studies 
 have shown that existing hardware-based TEEs are vulnerable to side-channe
 l attacks\, making their overall security guarantees questionable.\n In th
 is talk\, I will first show how side-channel attacks against hardware-base
 d TEEs can accurately reveal secrets\, such as private keys\, from confide
 ntial computations by exploiting memory page faults and branch prediction 
 behaviors. Then\, I will explain our countermeasures against the attacks\,
  which are based on program transformations and hardware primitives to ide
 ntify suspicious page faults and obfuscate branch execution histories. Las
 t\, I will discuss my research plan to securely and effectively use hardwa
 re-assisted security mechanisms.\n      \n Bio : Sangho Lee

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Ashvin Goel\, University of Toronto\nTitle:   "Scala
 ble Replay-Based Replication for Fast OLTP Databases" \n\nAbstract:  Datab
 ases commonly use primary-backup replication schemes for fault tolerance a
 nd disaster recovery. These schemes raise significant challenges for moder
 n\, in-memory databases\, which generate high transaction rates\, and reco
 very logs at close to memory bandwidth. It is hard to replay the recovery 
 log scalably on the backup\, making the backup a bottleneck. Moreover\, th
 e log transfer can cause network bottlenecks. Both these bottlenecks can s
 ignificantly slow the primary database.\n This work proposes addressing th
 ese problems by using record-replay for replicating fast databases. Our de
 sign enables replay to be performed scalably and concurrently\, allowing t
 he backup performance to scale with the primary. At the same time\, our ap
 proach requires only 15-20% of the network bandwidth required by tradition
 al logging\, reducing network infrastructure costs significantly.  \n \n \

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Pedram Ghodsnia\, David R. Cheriton School of Comput
 er Science\nTitle:   "Effective Use of SSDs in Database Systems" \n\nAbstr
 act:  With the advent of solid state drives (SSDs)\, the storage industry 
 has experienced a revolutionary improvement in I/O performance. Compared t
 o traditional hard disk drives (HDDs)\, SSDs benefit from shorter I/O late
 ncy\, better power efficiency\, and cheaper random I/Os. Because of these 
 superior properties\, SSDs are gradually replacing HDDs. For decades\, dat
 abase management systems have been designed\, architected\, and optimized 
 based on the performance characteristics of HDDs.  In order to utilize the
  superior performance of SSDs\, new methods should be developed\, some dat
 abase components should be redesigned\, and architectural decisions should
  be revisited.\n In this thesis\, novel methods are proposed to exploit th
 e new capabilities of modern SSDs to improve the performance of database s
 ystems. The first is a new method for using SSDs as a fully persistent sec
 ond level memory buffer pool. This method uses SSDs as a supplementary sto
 rage device to improve transactional throughput and to reduce the checkpoi
 nt and recovery times. A prototype of the proposed method is compared with
  its closest existing competitor. The second considers the impact of the p
 arallel I/O capability of modern SSDs on the database query optimizer. It 
 is shown that a query optimizer that is unaware of the parallel I/O capabi
 lity of SSDs can make significantly sub-optimal decisions. In addition\, a
  practical method for making the query optimizer parallel-I/O-aware is int
 roduced and evaluated empirically. The third technique is an SSD-friendly 
 external merge sort. This sorting technique has better performance than ot
 her common external sorting techniques. It also improves the SSD's lifespa
 n by reducing the number of write operations required during sorting.  \n

 -coefficient effects model for longitudinal data that can flexibly model d
 ifferent types of covariate effects. Different link functions can be selec
 ted to provide a rich family of models for longitudinal data. The mixed va
 rying-coefficient effects model accommodates constant effects\, time-varyi
 ng effects\, and covariate-varying effects. The time-varying effects are u
 nspecified functions of time and the covariate-varying effects are nonpara
 metric functions of a possibly time-dependent exposure variable. We develo
 p the semiparametric estimation procedure by using local linear smoothing 
 and profile weighted least squares estimation techniques. The method requi
 res smoothing in two different and yet connected domains for time and the 
 time-dependent exposure variable. The estimators of the nonparametric effe
 cts are obtained through aggregations to improve efficiency. The asymptoti
 c properties are investigated for the estimators of both nonparametric and
  parametric effects. Some hypothesis tests are developed to examine the co
 variate effects. The finite sample properties of the proposed estimators a
 nd tests are examined through simulations with satisfactory performances. 
 The proposed methods are used to analyze the ACTG 244 clinical trial to in
 vestigate the effects of antiretroviral treatment switching in HIV infecte

 served at 3:45 pm  \n\nAbstract:  We discuss geometry-based statistical le
 arning techniques for performing model reduction and modeling of certain c
 lasses of stochastic high-dimensional dynamical systems. We consider two c
 omplementary settings. In the first one\, we are given long trajectories o
 f a system\, e.g. from molecular dynamics\, and we estimate\, in a robust 
 fashion\, an effective number of degrees of freedom of the system\, which 
 may vary in the state space of then system\, and a local scale where the d
 ynamics is well-approximated by a reduced dynamics with a small number of 
 degrees of freedom. We then use these ideas to produce an approximation to
  the generator of the system and obtain\, via eigenfunctions of an empiric
 al Fokker-Planck equation (constructed from data)\, reaction coordinates f
 or the system that capture the large time behavior of the dynamics. We pre
 sent various examples from molecular dynamics illustrating these ideas. \n
 In the second setting we only have access to a (large number of expensive)
  simulators that can return short paths of the stochastic system\, and int
 roduce a statistical learning framework for estimating local approximation
 s to the system\, that can be (automatically) pieced together to form a fa
 st global reduced model for the system\, called ATLAS. ATLAS is guaranteed
  to be accurate (in the sense of producing stochastic paths whose distribu
 tion is close to that of paths generated by the original system) not only 
 at small time scales\, but also at large time scales\, under suitable assu
 mptions on the dynamics. We discuss applications to homogenization of roug
 h diffusions in low and high dimensions\, as well as relatively simple sys
 tems with separations of time scales\, and deterministic chaotic systems i
 n high-dimensions\, that are well-approximated by stochastic diffusion-lik
 e equations.  \n \n \n

 bstract:  Given an algebraic number\, how well can we approximate it by ra
 tional numbers\, relative to the "complexity" of those rational numbers?  
 Questions of this sort have long preoccupied number theorists.  However\, 
 it was only recently that this question was formulated and studied geometr
 ically.  Identifying numbers with points on the projective line\, the anal
 ogous geometric question is: given a projective variety $X$ and a closed s
 ubvariety $Z$ defined over $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$\, how well can we app
 roximate $Z$ with rational points on $X$\, relative to the "complexity" of
  the points in question?\n In this talk\, I will discuss McKinnon and Roth
 's formulation of this question in terms of "approximation constants" (in 
 the special case where $Z$ is a single point)\, including lower bounds on 
 these constants.  Afterwards\, I will outline a few results of my own\, in
 volving the computation of approximation constants for certain closed subv
 arieties of projective space.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Mizanur Rahaman\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, U
 niversity of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Eventually Entanglement Breaking Maps" \n
 \nAbstract:  Since its introduction\, the class of entanglement breaking m
 aps played a crucial role in the study of quantum information science and 
 also in the theory of completely positive maps. In this talk\, I will pres
 ent a certain\nclass of linear maps on matrix algebras that have the prope
 rty that they become entanglement breaking after composing finite or infin
 ite number\nof times with themselves. These maps are called eventually ent
 anglement breaking maps. This means that the Choi matrix of the iterated l
 inear map becomes separable in the tensor product space. It turns out that
 \nthe set of eventually entanglement breaking maps forms a rich class with
 in the set of all unital completely positive maps. I will connect these ma
 ps\nwith irreducible positive linear maps which have been studied a lot in
  the non-commutative Perron-Frobenius theory in operator algebra. Various 
 spectral proper-\nties of a ucp map on finite dimensional C*-algebras will
  be discussed. The motivation of this work is the "PPT-squared conjecture"
  made by M. Christandl that says every PPT channel\, when composed with it
 self\, becomes entanglement breaking. In this work\, it is proved that eve
 ry unital PPT-channel becomes entanglement breaking after finite iteration
 s. This is a joint work with Sam Jaques and Vern Paulsen.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Angèle Hamel\, Wilfrid Laurier University\nTitle:  
  "Chromatic Symmetric Functions and H-Free Graphs" \n\nAbstract:  Chromati
 c symmetric functions are defined in terms of colourings of particular gra
 phs. Some key conjectures in this area concern whether chromatic symmetric
  functions of claw-free graphs can be written in terms of other symmetric 
 functions with positive coefficients.  Here we extend the claw-free idea t
 o consider the e-positivity question for chromatic symmetric functions of 
 H-free graphs with H ={claw\, F}\,  where  F is a four-vertex graph.  We s
 ettle the question for all cases except H={claw\, co-diamond}\, and we pro
 vide some partial results in that case. This is joint work with Chinh Hoan
 g and Jake Tuero.  \n \n \n

 esearch\nTitle:   "Predicting Human Strategic Behavior: From Behavioral Ec
 onomics to Deep Learning" \n\nAbstract:  In order to do a good job of inte
 racting with people\, a system must have an adequate model of how people w
 ill react to its actions. This is particularly true in strategic settings:
  settings that contain multiple agents\, each with their own goals and pri
 orities\, in which each agent's ability to accomplish their goals depends 
 partly on the actions of the other agents. Standard models of strategic be
 havior assume that the participants are perfectly rational. However\, a we
 alth of experimental evidence shows that not only do human agents fail to 
 behave according to these models\, but that they frequently deviate from t
 hese models' predictions in a predictable\, systematic way.  \n In this ta
 lk\, I will survey my work on modeling human behavior in unrepeated\, simu
 ltaneous-move games. These games can be used to analyze a surprising numbe
 r of application domains\, such as the advertising auctions that fund the 
 major search engines\, or the algorithms that are used to optimize the all
 ocation of security personnel in ports and airports.\n     

 ience\nTitle:   "Incremental Difficulty in Platformer Games" \n\nAbstract:
   Designing difficulty levels in platformer games is a challenge for game 
 designers. It is important because design decisions that affect difficulty
  also directly affect player experience. Consequently\, design strategies 
 for balancing game difficulty are discussed by both academics and game des
 igners. \n In this paper\, we study how manipulating the following design 
 decisions\, commonly found in platformers\, moderates difficulty: Scroll S
 peed\, Target Size\, Jump Task Complexity\, and Perspective. Results for S
 croll Speed and Target Size indicate that errors increase as speed increas
 es and platform size decreases. However\, results for jump task complexity
  demonstrate a separation of errors from task complexity. Specifically\, w
 hile double-jump tasks are harder than single-jump tasks\, triple-jump tas
 ks appear to be as difficult as double-jump tasks. Additionally\, the stud
 y demonstrates how changes in perspective affect the errors made by player
 s in gameplay. The study results are applicable both to automatic level ge
 neration and dynamic difficulty adjustment in platformer games. \n This pa
 per was published at CHI 2017.  \n \n \n

  Science\nTitle:   "EC-Store: A Dynamic Distributed Erasure Coded Storage 
 System" \n\nAbstract:  Cloud storage systems typically choose between repl
 icating or erasure encoding data to provide fault tolerance. Replication e
 nsures that data can be accessed from a single site but incurs a much high
 er storage overhead\, which is a costly downside for large-scale storage s
 ystems. Erasure coding has a lower storage requirement but relies on encod
 ing/decoding and distributed data retrieval that can result in increased r
 esponse times. \n In this talk I will present EC-Store\, a dynamic distrib
 uted erasure coded storage system that significantly reduces data retrieva
 l times when compared to replicated and erasure coded storage systems. EC-
 Store achieves these reductions in latency by making intelligent data acce
 ss decisions and dynamically moving data in response to system load and ac
 cess patterns  \n \n \n

 Character Teammates in Cooperative Gameplay " \n\nAbstract:  Why do we ca
 re if our teammates are not human? This study seeks to uncover whether or 
 not the perception of other players as human or artificial entities can in
 fluence player experience. We use both deception and a between-participant
 s blind study design to reduce bias in our experiment. \n Our qualitative 
 results show that people do care about the perceived nature of other playe
 rs\, even though they are not always able to correctly identify them as hu
 man or as non-player character teammates. Interview data suggest believing
  that one is playing with other humans can positively affect a player's su
 bjective experience. Furthermore\, our qualitative results indicate that p
 layers view their non-player character teammates as humanized entities\, b
 ut adopt a neo-feudalistic (i.e.\, an unequal rights) view of them. Based 
 on our results\, we establish game design guidelines for non-player charac
 ter teammates leading to stronger\, emotional human-computer relationships
  in video games. \n This paper was published DIS2017.  \n \n \n

 tems of differential equations without a closed form solution\, small loca
 l errors in finite-dimensional solution approximations can propagate into 
 large deviations from the true underlying state trajectory. Inference for 
 such models relies on a likelihood approximation constructed around a nume
 rical solution\, which underestimates posterior uncertainty. This talk wil
 l introduce and discuss progress in a new adaptive formalism for modeling 
 and propagating discretization uncertainty through the Bayesian inferentia
 l framework\, allowing exact inference and uncertainty quantification for

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Feng-Xuan Choo\, David R. Cheriton School of Compute
 r Science\nTitle:   "Spaun 2.0: Extending the World's Largest Functional B
 rain Model" \n\nAbstract:  Building large-scale brain models is one method
  used by theoretical neuroscientists to understand the way the human brain
  functions. Researchers typically use either a bottom-up approach\, which 
 focuses on the detailed modelling of various biological properties of the 
 brain and places less importance on reproducing functional behaviour\, or 
 a top-down approach\, which generally aim to reproduce the behaviour obser
 ved in real cognitive agents\, but typically sacrifices adherence to const
 raints imposed by the neuro-biology. \n The focus of this thesis is Spaun\
 , a large-scale brain model constructed using a combination of the bottom-
 up and top-down approaches to brain modelling. Spaun is currently the worl
 d's largest functional brain model\, capable of performing 8 distinct cogn
 itive tasks ranging from digit recognition to inductive reasoning. The the
 sis is organized to discuss three aspects of the Spaun model.\n First\, it
  describes the original Spaun model\, and explores how a top-down approach
 \, known as the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA)\, has been combined wi
 th a bottom-up approach\, known as the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF)\
 , to integrate 6 existing cognitive models into a unified cognitive model 
 that is Spaun.\n Next\, the thesis identifies some of the concerns with th
 e original Spaun model\, and show the modifications made to the network to
  remedy these issues. It also characterizes how the Spaun model was re-org
 anized and re-implemented (to include the aforementioned modifications) as
  the Spaun 2.0 model. As part of the discussion of the Spaun 2.0 model\, t
 ask performance results are presented that compare the original Spaun mode
 l and the re-implemented Spaun 2.0 model\, demonstrating that the modifica
 tions to the Spaun 2.0 model have improved its accuracy on the working mem
 ory task\, and the two induction tasks.\n Finally\, three extensions to Sp
 aun 2.0 are presented. These extensions take advantage of the re-organized
  Spaun model\, giving Spaun 2.0 new capabilities: a motor system capable o
 f adapting to unknown force fields applied to its arm\; a visual system ca
 pable of processing $256\\times256$ full-colour images\; and the ability t
 o follow general instructions.\n The Spaun model and architecture presente
 d in this thesis demonstrate that by using the SPA and the NEF\, it is not
  only possible to construct functional large-scale brain models\, but to d
 o so in a manner that supports complex extensions to the model. The final 
 Spaun 2.0 model consists of about 6.6 million neurons\, can perform 12 cog
 nitive tasks\, and has been demonstrated to reproduce behavioural and neur
 ological data observed in natural cognitive agents.  \n \n \n

 r Science\nTitle:   "Succinct Color Searching in One Dimension" \n\nAbstra
 ct:  We present succinct data structures for one-dimensional color reporti
 ng and color counting problems. We are given a set of $n$ points with inte
 ger coordinates in the range $[1\,m]$ and every point is assigned a color 
 from the set $\\{\\\,1\,\\ldots\,\\sigma\\\,\\}$. A color reporting query 
 asks for the list of distinct colors that occur in a query interval $[a\,b
 ]$ and a color counting query asks for the number of distinct colors in $[
 a\,b]$.\n We describe a succinct data structure that answers approximate c
 olor counting queries in $O(1)$ time and uses $\\mathcal{B}(n\,m) + O(n) +
  o(\\mathcal{B}(n\,m))$ bits\, where $\\mathcal{B}(n\,m)$ is the minimum n
 umber of bits required to represent an arbitrary set of size $n$ from a un
 iverse of $m$ elements. Thus we show\, somewhat counterintuitively\, that 
 it is not necessary to store colors of points in order to answer approxima
 te color counting queries. In the special case when points are in the rank
  space (i.e.\, when $n=m$)\, our data structure needs only $O(n)$ bits. Al
 so\, we show that $\\Omega(n)$ bits are necessary in that case.\n Then we 
 turn to succinct data structures for color reporting. We describe a data s
 tructure that uses $\\mathcal{B}(n\,m) + nH_d(S) + o(\\mathcal{B}(n\,m)) +
  o(n\\lg\\sigma)$ bits and answers queries in $O(k+1)$ time\, where $k$ is
  the number of colors in the answer\, and $nH_d(S)$ ($d=\\log_{\\sigma} n$
 ) is the $d$-th order empirical entropy of the color sequence. Finally\, w
 e consider succinct color reporting under restricted updates.\n Our dynami
 c data structure uses $nH_d(S)+o(n\\lg\\sigma)$ bits and supports queries 
 in $O(k+1)$ time.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Ahmed El-Roby\, David R. Cheriton School of Computer
  Science\nTitle:   "Web Data Integration for the Non-Expert" \n\nAbstract:
   Today\, there is an abundance of structured data available on the web in
  the form of RDF graphs and relational (i.e.\, tabular) data. This data co
 mes from heterogeneous sources\, and realizing its full value requires int
 egrating these sources so that they can be queried together. Due to the sc
 ale and heterogeneity of the data sources on the web\, integrating them is
  typically an automatic process. However\, automatic data integration appr
 oaches are not completely accurate since they infer semantics from syntax 
 in data sources with a high degree of heterogeneity. Therefore\, these aut
 omatic approaches can be considered as a first step to quickly get reasona
 ble quality data integration output that can be used in issuing queries ov
 er the data sources. A second step is refining this output over time while
  it is being used. Interacting with the data sources through the output of
  the data integration system and refining this output requires expertise i
 n data management\, which limits the scope of this activity to power users
  and consequently limits the usability of data integration systems.\n This
  thesis focuses on helping non-expert users to access heterogeneous data s
 ources through data integration systems\, without requiring the users to h
 ave prior knowledge of the queried data sources or exposing them to the de
 tails of the output of the data integration system. In addition\, the user
 s can provide feedback over the answers to their queries\, which can then 
 be used to refine and improve the quality of the data integration output. 
 \n The thesis studies both RDF and relational data. For RDF data\, the the
 sis focuses on helping non-expert users to query heterogeneous RDF data so
 urces\, and utilizing their feedback over query answers to improve the qua
 lity of the interlinking between these data sources. For relational data\,
  the thesis focuses on improving the quality of the mediated schema for a 
 set of relational data sources and the semantic mappings between these sou
 rces based on user feedback over query answers.  \n \n
