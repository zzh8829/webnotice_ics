DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  David Gosset\, IBM - T.J. Watson Research Center\nTi
 tle:   "Algorithms and complexity for quantum advantage" \n\nAbstract:  Th
 ere is strong evidence that a sufficiently large fault-tolerant quantum co
 mputer would solve certain computational problems exponentially faster tha
 n any classical computer. How can quantum algorithms and complexity theory
  help guide the way forward in our current era of small and noisy quantum 
 computers?\n A quantum computer without error correction will likely be li
 mited to implementing short depth quantum circuits.  In the first part of 
 the talk I will describe a linear algebra problem which is solved by a con
 stant-depth quantum circuit but provably cannot be solved by any classical
  circuit of less than logarithmic depth. This constitutes an unconditional
  separation between constant depth quantum circuits and their classical co
 unterparts.\n Classical simulation algorithms can be used to verify small 
 quantum computers and to help demarcate the classically easy and hard regi
 mes. In the second part of the talk I will describe a classical algorithm 
 that can be used to simulate quantum circuits over the Clifford+T gate set
  with mildly exponential scaling in the number of T gates.\n Finally\, I w
 ill discuss how quantum computer science is intimately linked with our und
 erstanding of physical systems and the complexity of simulating them. I wi
 ll describe how a universal quantum computer is equivalent in computationa
 l power to a quantum many-body system consisting of indistinguishable part
 icles which move and interact on the vertices of a graph.  \n \n \n

 am maps on polygons in any dimension\, which extend R. Schwartz's definiti
 on of the 2D pentagram map. Many of those maps turn out to be discrete int
 egrable dynamical systems\, while the corresponding continuous limits of s

 ftware Analysis and Intelligence Lab\, Queen's University\nTitle:   "Makin
 g Performance Engineering More Accessible to Software Developers" \n\nAbst
 ract:  Performance is extremely important for software systems. For exampl
 e\, a one-second slowdown of the checkout process would cost Amazon $1.6 b
 illion per year. Despite the importance of performance\, all too often it 
 is considered as the last step in product delivery\, and it is often done 
 by operators and system engineers instead of with actual developers. Howev
 er\, many performance-related decisions\, such as those about the configur
 ation and monitoring of a software system\, would benefit tremendously fro
 m the input of software developers. Unfortunately\, many developers are no
 t sufficiently trained to tackle performance challenges in practice.\n In 
 my presentation\, I will discuss why performance engineering and software 
 development should go hand in hand. First\, I highlight examples of perfor
 mance challenges based on several longitudinal studies that we conducted o
 n the Linux kernel and the Steam gaming platform. Then\, I present two exa
 mples of how we can make performance engineering more accessible to develo
 pers. In the first example\, I show how performance analytics can help opt
 imize performance-related configuration options. In the second example\, I
  show how performance analytics can help one make informed decisions about
  the tradeoffs between the amount of information that is being logged in a
  software system and its field performance.\n      \n Bio :

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Jeffrey Shallit\, David R. Cheriton School of Comput
 er Science\, University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "Waring's theorem for binary
  k'th powers and palindromes" \n\nAbstract:  Recently there has been some 
 interest in analogues of Waring's theorem for other kinds of sets analogou
 s to powers of integers.  For example\, Banks proved that every natural nu
 mber is the sum of at most 49 numbers whose base-10 expansion is a palindr
 ome\, and this was improved to 3 for all bases $b \\ge 5$ by Cilleruelo\, 
 Luca\, and Baster.\n In this talk I will discuss some recent results about
  palindromes in bases 2\, 3\, 4 and binary k'th powers. (A binary k'th pow
 er is an integer whose base-2 expansion consists of k consecutive identica
 l blocks.) In particular\, I'll show that for all $k \\ge 1$ there exists 
 a constant W(k) such that every sufficiently large multiple of $\\gcd(k\, 
 2^k - 1)$ is the sum of W(k) binary k'th  powers.\n This is joint work wit

 :   "CSIS Bulk Data Collection and National Security Surveillance" \n\nAbs
 tract:  Canadians arguably have a much better idea about what kinds of mas
 s surveillance activities are occurring among some of Canada's intelligenc
 e partners in the "Five Eyes" than about what is occurring in Canada. It i
 s clear\, for example\, that the UK's security intelligence has been colle
 cting vast troves of government\, commercial and telecommunications record
 s\, but Canadian practices are relatively unknown. A Canadian Federal Cour
 t ruling in 2016 found the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) t
 o have breached its duty of candour to the court in failing\, for over 10 
 years\, to inform the court that it was indefinitely retaining information
  on third parties unrelated to threats to the security of Canada to add to
  its bulk data holdings. This explosive ruling was delivered during the co
 untry's first ever national security consultation\, which resulted in a sw
 eeping new national security omnibus bill (C-59). This talk will outline h
 ow C-59 proposes to address bulk data collection by Canadian intelligence

 ct:  Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices with one random vertex coloured bl
 ack and all the other vertices coloured white. In the language of populati
 on genetics\, this corresponds to a single (advantageous) mutant appearing
  in a structured population of indistinguishable residents. Moran process 
 is a certain discrete-time stochastic process that changes the colouring o
 f the vertices in such a way that eventually the vertices become either al
 l white (the mutant went extinct) or all black (the mutant fixated). \
 n Evolutionary graph theory studies how the fixation probability $\\fp(G)$
  depends on the underlying graph structure. For example it is known that $
 \\fp(K_n)=\\fp(C_n)<\\fp(S_n)$ where $K_n$\, $C_n$\, $S_n$ are the complet

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Chris Schafhauser\, Department of Pure Mathematics\,
  University of Waterloo\nTitle:   "An Embedding Theorem for C*-algebras" \
 n\nAbstract:  A C*-algebra consists of an algebra of bounded linear operat
 ors acting on a Hilbert space which is closed the adjoint operation (rough
 ly\, the transpose) and is complete in a certain metric.  Typical examples
  include the ring of $n \\times n$ complex matrices and the ring C(X) of r
 epresentation of continuous functions from a compact space X to the comple
 x numbers.  Many more interesting examples arise from various dynamical ob
 jects (e.g. group and group actions) and from various geometric/topologica
 l constructions.\n The structure of finite dimensional C*-algebras is well
  understood: they are finite direct sums of complex matrix algebras.  The 
 class of approximately finite-dimensional (AF) C*-algebras\, ones which ma
 y be written as (the closure of) an increasing union of finite-dimensional
  subalgebras\, are also well understood: they are determined up to isomorp
 hism by their module structure.   However\, the class of sub-algebras of A
 F-algebras is still rather mysterious\; it includes\, for instance\, all c
 ommutative C*-algebras and all C*-algebras generated by amenable groups.  
 It is a long-standing problem to find an abstract characterization of suba
 lgebras of AF-algebras.\n I will discuss this class of algebras and a rece
 nt partial answer to this AF-Embedding problem.  My goal is to keep the ta
 lk accessible and mostly expository.  In particular\, I won't assume any p
 rior knowledge of operator algebras or functional analysis.  \n \n \n

  Side Channels in Production Software" \n\nAbstract:  Side-channel attacks
  recover secret information by analyzing the physical implementation of cr
 yptosystems based on non-functional computational characteristics\, e.g. t
 ime\, power\, and acoustic. Among all well-known side channels\, cache-bas
 ed side channels are notoriously severe\, leading to practical attacks aga
 inst certain implementations of theoretically secure crypto algorithms\, s
 uch as RSA\, ElGamal and AES. Such attacks target the hierarchical design 
 of the modern computer memory system\, where different memory access patte
 rns of a program can bring observable cache status difference.\n In this t
 alk\, Shuai Wang will present novel techniques to help software developers
  identify potential vulnerabilities that can lead to cache-based side chan
 nel attacks. The technique leverages constraint solving to detect potentia
 l cache access differences at each program point. He will also describe tw
 o approaches\, which leverage symbolic execution and abstract interpretati
 on to deliver scalable detection of side channels. The proposed techniques
  have been implemented into two practical tools\, and both tools have disc
 overed a large number of known and unknown side-channel vulnerabilities fr
 om real-world cryptosystems. He will conclude by discussing opportunities 
 he is excited to explore in the future\, including supporting the detectio
 n of new side-channel threats\, eliminating side-channel vulnerabilities f
 rom existing software\, and providing new infrastructures for side-channel
  detection on x86 and IoT platforms.\n      \n Bio : Shuai W

 ence of water at the bed of the Antarctic ice sheets is known to be a firs
 t order control on the speed of the overlying ice. In many regions\, distr
 ibution and flux of this water is complicated by multi-year storage in sub
 glacial lake basins. With more lakes and pockets of stored water being ide
 ntified every year from satellite surface altimetry measurements and radio
 -echo sounding\, it is apparent that constraining the impact of this water
  is an important step for determining the drivers of Antarctic ice dynamic
 s.\n Using a numerical modeling approach\, I examine the controls on subgl
 acial Antarctic lake growth and drainage within ice streams. I also assess
  whether the drainage of these lakes has an impact on the dynamics of the 
 ice stream. The methods to achieve this utilize GlaDS\, a 2-D finite eleme
 nt subglacial hydrology model\, which incorporates development of a coexis
 ting distributed and efficient drainage system. The model is applied both 
 to a synthetic system and to Recovery Ice Stream in the East Antarctic wit
 h bed topography determined from mass conservation inversion techniques. T
 he model outputs of lake growth and drainage are compared with satellite s
 urface altimetry measurements.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Sam Kim\, Department of Pure Mathematics\, Universit
 y of Waterloo\nTitle:   "On Synchronous Quantum Games" \n\nAbstract:  We w
 ill discuss the notion of synchronous quantum games. Unlike general quantu
 m games\, synchronous games have the advantage of having a purely C*-algeb
 raic characterization of their correlation sets but still retain the full 
 strength of its not necessarily synchronous counterpart. We will talk abou
 t how different models of physical systems are distinguished using synchro
 nous games and how the distinguishing of two synchronous correlation sets 
 relates to Connes' embedding problem.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Ricardo Salmon\, David R. Cheriton School of Compute
 r Science\nTitle:   "From SAT to Stochastic SAT" \n\nAbstract:  Stochastic
  satisfiability (SSAT) problems are an extension of SAT problems that is P
 SPACE-complete and in the same complexity class as quantified Boolean form
 ula (QBF) and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs).\n W
 e show how to extend techniques from SAT into a stochastic solver called P
 rime\, that solves probabilistic inference and POMDP problems. Similar to 
 SAT and other NP-hard problems\, where a lot of research has been invested
 \, we hope to encourage further research into SSAT. The results show that 
 our solver is able to tackle large problems and is very competitive.  \n \

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Dimitrios Skrepetos\, David R. Cheriton School of Co
 mputer Science\nTitle:   "Faster Approximate  Diameter and Distance Oracle
 s in Planar Graphs" \n\nAbstract:  We present an algorithm that computes a
  (1+\\varepsilon)-approximation of the diameter of a weighted\, undirected
  planar graph of n vertices with non-negative edge lengths in O(n \\log n 
 (\\log n + (1/\\varepsilon)^5)) expected time\, improving upon the O(n ((1
 /\\varepsilon)^4 \\log^4 n + 2^{O(1/\\varepsilon)}))-time algorithm of Wei
 mann and Yuster [ICALP 2013]. \n Our algorithm makes two improvements over
  that result: first and foremost\, it replaces the exponential dependency 
 on 1/\\varepsilon with a polynomial one\, by adapting and specializing Cab
 ello's recent abstract-Voronoi-diagram-based technique [SODA 2017] for app
 roximation purposes\; second\, it shaves off two logarithmic factors by ch
 oosing a better sequence of error parameters  during recursion. \n Moreove
 r\, using similar techniques\, we improve the (1+\\varepsilon)-approximate
  distance oracle of Gu and Xu [ISAAC 2015] by first replacing the exponent
 ial dependency on 1/\\varepsilon on the preprocessing time and space with 
 a polynomial one and second removing a logarithmic factor from the preproc
 essing time.  \n \n \n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Pedram Ghodsnia\, David R. Cheriton School of Comput
 er Science\nTitle:   "Effective Use of SSDs in Database Systems" \n\nAbstr
 act:  With the advent of solid state drives (SSDs)\, the storage industry 
 has experienced a revolutionary improvement in I/O performance. Compared t
 o traditional hard disk drives (HDDs)\, SSDs benefit from shorter I/O late
 ncy\, better power efficiency\, and cheaper random I/Os. Because of these 
 superior properties\, SSDs are gradually replacing HDDs. For decades\, dat
 abase management systems have been designed\, architected\, and optimized 
 based on the performance characteristics of HDDs.  In order to utilize the
  superior performance of SSDs\, new methods should be developed\, some dat
 abase components should be redesigned\, and architectural decisions should
  be revisited.\n In this thesis\, novel methods are proposed to exploit th
 e new capabilities of modern SSDs to improve the performance of database s
 ystems. The first is a new method for using SSDs as a fully persistent sec
 ond level memory buffer pool. This method uses SSDs as a supplementary sto
 rage device to improve transactional throughput and to reduce the checkpoi
 nt and recovery times. A prototype of the proposed method is compared with
  its closest existing competitor. The second considers the impact of the p
 arallel I/O capability of modern SSDs on the database query optimizer. It 
 is shown that a query optimizer that is unaware of the parallel I/O capabi
 lity of SSDs can make significantly sub-optimal decisions. In addition\, a
  practical method for making the query optimizer parallel-I/O-aware is int
 roduced and evaluated empirically. The third technique is an SSD-friendly 
 external merge sort. This sorting technique has better performance than ot
 her common external sorting techniques. It also improves the SSD's lifespa
 n by reducing the number of write operations required during sorting.  \n
